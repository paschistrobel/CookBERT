Lipids are hydrophobic and will prevent further hydration of the glutenin.Using a lower-protein flour will also help. If you're not already using cake flour, the reason it's called cake flour is because of the lower protein content.That being said, have you actually tried leaving the batter coarse? Just because the batter is lumpy does not mean that the cake will have big lumps. The entire mixture is wet, so unless you leave huge lumps of dry flour in the batter, you won't end up with a lumpy cake. There's a difference between \"don't overmix\" and \"don't mix\" - you're supposed to mix enough to incorporate, just don't try homogenize it. CANNOTANSWER",

That freezer is pretty much only used for overflow freezer space, and the refrigerator section is used for beer bottles and kegs, and we have had a few apples in the crispers for most of the year, but that's it. The freezer section was rarely opened more than once per week.The cheesecake had no off flavors, and only had light water crystallisation on the surface, which was not at all detrimental to our enjoyment of the cake.This was a plain 'real' cooked cheesecake with graham cracker crust.So, for a 'good enough' storage method, wrap loosely in foil and store in a freezer that is rarely used, and the cheesecake should be excellent for at least one year.

I watch it come together and add enough more water so that it all sticks together.I knead it a few times by hand, put it on a bowl on the counter covered with kitchen towel, and let it sit for a day out on the counter.This is basically the Mark Bittman recipe, except I leave it to sit for way longer than he recommends.The pizza dough is always pretty easy to shape and tastes good. But, it is better tasting and easier to roll thin in the winter. I live in Maryland, so I assume our heat and humidity are the difference. Even with the AC running , the house tends to be 5-10 degrees warmer in the summer and there is a lot more moisture in the air.The dough looks and feels identical as I take it out the machine, but while it rests, something is obviously different.How do I adjust the recipe for the summer to make the dough have the same texture and qualities as it does in the winter?",

That's a pretty basic fact of baking, there are even recipes which insist on using ice cold water for making bread. If you want to have the same effect in summer, you should use cold water. As cold as possible, I even tried once slush from the ice cream machine just for kicks and it indeed produced very strong gluten (actually too strong for my preferences). You should use the cold water on the actual dough. The sponge should use room temperature water, because ice cold water is rather unpleasant to yeast. They can live with it after they've been reawakened from their dry state, but it's not good to use it for their hydration. CANNOTANSWER",

If it comes out a little on the dry side the first time, you might try adding a tablespoon of milk next time. Or even just increase the oil.

      "title": "What temperature would a \"quiet oven\" be in old fashioned temperature vocabulary?",
      "background": "Iâm looking at a couple of recipes from the early twentieth century. One calls for a quick oven. The temperature for that (375 - 400Â°F) was easy enough to work out, several places online have it, including a 2010 Q&A from this site. The other one, quiet oven, is proving a little more challenging. (If this is a mistake, it was a typo/typesetting mistake in the original article: it is a newspaper article and is pretty clearly 'quiet'.) I am leaning toward âslow ovenâ, 300-325Â°F, because it is difficult to imagine anything being cooked at lower temperatures. (It is a sweet potato biscuit if that makes a difference to anyoneâs logic process.)So, any ideas what a âquiet ovenâ might be?",
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "Well, quiet and quick look similar to an OCR, especially one with a spell-checking dictionary looking at faded and/or poorly forged letterset.If you have ever reacted buttermilk and baking soda, you know that it is a violent reaction, and one that is not endless. If you want your batter to rise and keep its form, you would use a hot preheated oven to capture the bubbles, a quick oven.So I am pretty sure that a quiet oven is actually quick.The only thing that it could possibly be if quiet is really what was meant and an accurate description of the oven, in my opinion, is a stage in the wood-firing of a bakers oven where there are only coals glowing and the oven isnât making any sound. But that is an assumption that I have no reference for. (And this would probably be a very hot environment, ergo quiet = quick).Thinking about this some more, linguistically speaking, a âquick ovenâ might be a shortened form for âquick oveningâ. This could come from a German baker who anglicized the German: e.g. schnellbacken which is implicitly only possible in a very hot environment, regardless of the oven type. It would also mean that you donât have time to do errands or chores while the biscuit is in the oven. CANNOTANSWER",

It's hard to fully express the majesty of this dish, and should only be enjoyed on special occasions, like the Super Bowl.In Canada (which I consider to be basically \"American\"), it's also fairly common to add or replace the tomato sauce with pesto sauce. Soft goat cheese is another common additive. Perhaps these sound \"Italian\" but I'd consider an Italian pasta to be something more like a bolognese, carbonara, alfredo, or even the trusty old butter/olive oil and parmesan cheese. You'll almost never see tomato sauce combined with pesto sauce in an authentic Italian restaurant (or in Italy), but it's common in American home cooking. CANNOTANSWER",

However, underdone bread sometimes is prone to earlier spoilage, since it generally has a higher moisture content that might promote some mold, bacterial, and yeast growth after baking. The chances of it becoming actually hazardous without noticeably spoiling are probably rather low, but it's possible, particularly if the moisture content is high enough. It's much more likely that the bread would just spoil normally through the appearance of surface molds, etc., though.

Hogwash, ignore those comments. The bottom line is that \"floaters\" are perfectly safe, and there is nothing \"icky\" about them, although they may take longer to fully cook. So, it becomes a matter of personal choice. If it's important to you that all of your chickpeas cook to exactly the same degree of tenderness, throw them out.

      "background": "I do have a kind of problem with cooking basmati rice in my rice cooker.I am following the cooker instructions - for two cups (the cooker one, not the measurement unit) I use 200 ml of water. As far as rice goes, I am washing it multiple times - about 5 times every time, until the water is more or less clean and even let it soak for a few hours sometimes. But there are two problems :Sometimes there is some kind of white foam coming from the rice which will somehow alter the cooking and eventually ruin the rice. There's a lot of foam and the rice has got a really bad taste afterwards and some weird texture.Even when the foam is not present the rice is burned on the bottom of the cooker - I know I shouldn't trust ads, but the cooker was said not to be sticky one :(Any help will be appreciated, thanks",

I've had success with Basmati rice in a Black and Decker rice cooker but solely if I soak for 35+ minutes and add a tbsp of olive oil and a 1/4 tsp of salt to it. But the Walmart rice cooker I used to have which was made in China had the foam issue you describe. I believe the foam is due to rice starch and water and air mixing and the \"dum\" method required for achieving proper cooked Basmati rice is impossible to do when the rice cooker does not trap steam fully.I would suggest purchasing Jasmine or other short grain rices instead of using Basmati with the type of rice cooker you seem to have.

Add 1-2 tsp. to perk up sauces, soups, gravies and casseroles.In my experience, I use a little less tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce. As Sean mentioned, it's definitely a bit stronger than regular soy sauce. I eyeball most of the time, but I'd say I use 1/2 to 3/4 portion of tamari when substituting it for regular soy sauce.I reach for the tamari when I want a bit more of a complex flavor on something plain like rice - when the soy sauce is to be the star of the dish, essentially. I tend to use regular soy sauce when mixing into a larger homemade sauce or where the soy sauce flavor will blend into the background because the recipe calls for so many other strong ingredients.

          "context": "Starch content and sweetness:Bananas become sweeter as they ripen because the starch is broken down. An unripe banana is full of complex carbohydrates, but as it ripens, these are broken down into simple sugars which is why riper bananas are sweeter. The lower starch content and higher sugar content also means that the banana is digested more quickly, so it becomes a slightly higher GI food as it ripens.Antioxidant levels: Riper bananas also have higher levels of antioxidants. The brown spots on the skin are formed when the chlorophyll breaks down into antioxidants. These are very good for your body as they help prevent cell damage.Calorie count: As the banana ripens, the calorie count stays the same. Even though the nutrients change, all carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram so the total remains the sameVitamins and minerals: As the fruit ripens, the micronutrients tend to decrease. Water soluble vitamins like vitamin C, folic acid and thiamin decrease. But the banana will still have a lot of potassium. You can store a ripe banana in the fridge to prevent some of these nutrients from being lost. CANNOTANSWER",

This allows the individual cells to partially deflate, expressing water and making the overall vegetable wilt.Think a blown up beach ball. Although the wall is soft and flexible, the air holds it rigid. Of course, air can be compressed, so a beach ball can be squeezed; but water for all practical purposes is not compressible, so there is no almost no give in the individual plant cells. Once the cell walls loose their integrity, however, it is like the beach balls that comprise the plant have sprung a leak.

Estimates of how much turkey to plan per person vary widely across the internet; does anyone have authoritative data on how much turkey to buy? There's clearly a difference between a small child and a hefty eater, for example, and I'd imagine the meat-to-bone ratio changes as the turkey gets larger or smaller. I also want to plan to have leftovers, since my family enjoys leftover turkey sandwiches. Does it matter how many sides I plan to make?

This way it'll only take a minute or two to cook through and won't overcook the crumb. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "Apfelschorle is a German (or Austrian?) drink which is made with approximately a 1:1 ratio of apple juice and sparkling (carbonated) mineral water. My technique is simply to pour the appropriate amount of apple juice and water (both chilled) into a cup, give it a stir, and then drink. When I had bottled Apfelschorle in Germany (primarly two brands: Gerolsteiner and Lift), the bubbles were delicate and small, like in a bottle of champagne. I preferred the Gerolsteiner brand, which had a bit more delicate bubbles and better apple flavor. I've tried making it at home in the US with an approximately 1:1 ratio of seltzer water (La Croix brand) and apple juice (Mott's brand). The flavor is close to Lift (I suspect higher quality apple juice would give a better depth of flavor and the mineral content is different as well which might also affect the flavor) which is acceptable, but the mouthfeel is all wrong -- the bubbles are typically big and don't last as long as either Lift or Gerolsteiner; only a few sips have the right mouthfeel. Is there a way to get the right mouthfeel without resorting to buying (expensive in the US) European mineral waters? I drink a decent amount of seltzer water, so even if it requires equipment to carbonate water at home, I might be willing to invest in it.",

A mixture of apple juice and water that is then carbonated (as your bottled product would be) is quite different from a mixture of still apple juice and carbonated water.I know that both alcoholic and non-alcoholic carbonated cider/apple juice typically have small bubbles. And you can purchase carbonated apple juice in the US, (often seen/marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to champagne) as well as an increasingly wide variety of alcoholic ciders.I don't know how mixing carbonated juice and carbonated water would work out, but it would have much better odds of being somewhat like what you want. For even better odds, start with an empty, chilled bottle (suitable for carbonated drinks) and pour both ingredients into it, then seal the top and let them meld in the fridge under pressure for a while (perhaps a day), rather than stirring in an open cup. That MIGHT even work for the still juice, although it would be limited in carbonation.If you got a carbonation system of some sort, you could start with apple juice and water mixed, and then force carbonate that.

The holes are pockets or cells in the gluten network in the loaf--so the stronger the gluten network, the larger the holes can expand during proofing. similarly, the more active the yeast, or the longer the proof, the larger the holes will have the potential to expand.So large holes tend to be found in breads with strong gluten networks, which have longer proofing times. These loaves will have chewier texture, and yeastier flavor, which can be very delicious.For other applications, such as a typical US-style sandwich bread, the desire is for a more tender product, which is indicative of less gluten development; also, large holes would let spreads or condiments soak through the bread more easily, which is not so desirable in a sandwich to be eaten out of hand. So these loaves are typically ones with smaller holes.So the holes are either a factor themselves (as in sandwich bread), or indicative of other qualities of the loaf (as in so-called artisan style bread)--but either way, they are a very visible indicator of the nature of the loaf, and so getting the desired holes will help get the desired loaf qualities.I am sure there are many more qualified bread experts who will give you a more detailed answer...

The food isn't stuck in the holes, it's stuck on the little points.Rinsing it under the highest pressure water my sink has doesn't blow away the food matter either, it's just all snagged there pretty tightly.I found this page about graters and the author there seems to just avoid that side of the grater specifically because of how hard it is to clean, so perhaps there is no hope here.I do not have a dishwasher. Even though the above picture has ginger fibers on it, I'm not looking for techniques just for this specific case (that just happened to be what was stuck on the grater when I took the picture). I have the same problem with this side of the grater no matter what I grate, e.g. cheese, even hard cheese, leaves bits of cheese there, which are slightly easier to remove with hot water than tangled fibers are, but still not easy.What can I use to quickly and conveniently clean this after each use? The cleaning difficulty makes this my least favorite kitchen tool. I'm never excited when it looks like I have to use it.",

As for the bag being loose it may very well have a hole in it, it's more likely to have happened in the freezer than during thawing. Because you froze it yourself and the packaging was good you know whatever happened occurred after you bought it, so it should be just fine. If you bought it frozen then I would suggest throwing it out because you don't know when the packaging was broken or what the food could have been exposed to. CANNOTANSWER",

Can I premix wet ingredients as well?I understand that I can't premix the full batter when using leavening agents -- I am curious if I can save some time the day of while preparing the batter by premixing both the wet and dry ingredients separately beforehand.The following is an example of a recipe for which I was thinking of doing this (wet ingredients would be the egg and buttermilk mixture):Ingredients  1 1/4 cups buttermilk, milk, or yogurt (or 1 1/4 cups milk plus 1 tablespoon white vinegar; see Step 2), plus more as needed  2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil  1 1/2 cups medium-grind cornmeal  1/2 cup all-purpose flour  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  1 teaspoon salt  1 tablespoon sugar, plus more if you like sweet corn bread  1 egg  InstructionsPreheat the oven to 375Â°F.If youâre using buttermilk, milk, or yogurt, ignore this step. If not, make the soured milk: Warm the milk gentlyâ1 minute in the microwave is sufficient, just enough to take the chill offâand add the vinegar. Let it rest while you prepare the other ingredients.Put the butter in a medium ovenproof skillet or an 8-inch square baking pan over medium heat; heat until good and hot, about 2 minutes, then turn off the heat. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Mix the egg into the buttermilk. Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients (just enough to combine); if it seems too dry, add another tablespoon or two of buttermilk. Pour the batter into the prepared skillet or pan, smooth out the top if necessary, and put in the oven.Bake about 30 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the sides have pulled away from the pan; a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean.

That happens when the wet and dry mix so you're fine.Two things to watch out for:The eggs and buttermilk are going to be more prone to spoiling after they are removed from their containers. Additionally, the batter could pick up funny flavors from the fridge. Storing in an appropriate container in the fridge and using it the next day would avoid any issues.The wet ingredients, including the eggs, are emulsified when they are mixed. The oil dissolves into the buttermilk with the help of the egg yolks. This emulsification is important for the texture of quick breads. The emulsion is not indestructible. If you find your oil has separated in the morning you may need to beat it again to reemulsify before combining with the dry.Note: your title says \"and cakes\". Cakes are assembled with different methods such as creaming or beating egg whites. These could not be done in advance without destroying the texture of the cake. CANNOTANSWER",

One review for the product I'm likely to buy said \"These pans burn everything I bake in them.... They cook too fast.

A change in bakeware material or thickness may alter how quickly heat is transferred from the air in the oven to the food, perhaps enough to change cooking time in some cases but not significantly enough to burn things. Take for example a thick cast-iron pan versus a thin aluminum pan, the aluminum pan will get up to temperature very quickly and the cast-iron slowly as aluminum has a much higher coefficient of heat transfer than iron, and there's less of it to heat. If you're baking cookies then this could make a difference in your overall cooking time as on the aluminum sheet would start cooking the bottom of the cookies faster than the iron, and cooking time is short. In a cake it isn't likely to make any noticeable difference to cooking time at all. In neither case would food suddenly burn - the heat difference between the food and the oven air isn't enough. If a 350F oven didn't burn food with one pan it's not suddenly going to reduce your food to a pile of ash with a different pan. I don't know what happened with this reviewer, perhaps their oven broke coincidently at the same time they bought the pans, or perhaps they just made it up - who knows! I'd ignore that in favor of other reviews. CANNOTANSWER",

      "title": "Steel Pan non-stick improvement by polishing",
      "background": "I recently started to research into my cookwares and decided a stainless-steel pan was a good budget investment to learn to cook better my steaks and other items. I cooked my first steaks over the last few weeks and they were great, they didn't stick and came out delicious.FYI: usually I cook the steak by seasoning it with some olive oil rubbed in then saltingand peppering it and letting it rest till it is at room temperature. To cook it I bring thepan to high heat until droplets of water slip on it as if they were mercury, add a tbsp ofoil and place the steak on, reverse it after about 3min with tongs and remove after aboutanother 3 min. The cuts I use are often thin.However there is one problem I have not been able to get over; the steak does not stick but its seasoning will and over the cooking period burns. This causes smoke and a real headache to clean while trying not to use a scourer side of a sponge or metal wire as I have been adamantly told it will ruin the pan's surface (this got me thinking... read on)!So over to my question which may be a little out the box, I am a materials engineer with access to metal work machines, to my knowledge a perfectly flat surface offers less surface area to stick so if I were to buffet the pan until it were nicely polished on the surface (currently I can see all the circular grooves from the fabrication process such as you see on brushed steel) would this help reduce the sticking? Or can I simply improve the way I cook the steak and avoid the seasoning sticking and burning?",
      "paragraphs": [
        {
          "context": "(1) It is worth noting that many people prefer stainless steel pans to cook meats on because they are NOT non-stick (meaning they stick). The fat rendered during cooking, along with the bits of fat and meat that stick to the surface are called \"fond\" and are used to make pan sauces to serve with the meat. This is a big selling point for SS pans.(2) Polishing the surface of your pans to a mirror-finish won't make your pans non-stick. The sticking has more to do with the properties of the stainless steel itself rather than with the buffing of the surface. Some people have suggested that you can season a SS pan like you can a cast-iron pan to make the surface non-stick but that sounds fishy (but, admittedly, I have never actually tried that - I used different types of pans for different types of cooking).(3) Some seasonings just burn very easily - like paprika. Seasonings that burn easily will most likely burn or scorch whether they are still on your meat, or if they have strayed to the pan. Any spices that might burn should be applied shortly before the meat finishes cooking or applied when you serve it. CANNOTANSWER",

Make sure to shake the can of coconut milk before opening to ensure it is not separated. Add 1/2 the can to the pot. Bring to boil, reduce temperature and allow the mixture to reduce to almost a paste like texture. This will allow the coconut flavors to intensify, and give you a thicker starting point.The key is to reduce some of your sauce before cooking everything else; if you attempt to reduce your entire sauce with the vegetables, they will overcook because the process takes too long. Once reduced, add the other 1/2 of the coconut mixture. You end up with a very silky, smooth coconut sauce. Afterwards add your curry paste, fish sauce, sugar, Thai basil etc. CANNOTANSWER",

How hard is the fully-cooked grain as compared to other rice types (including wild rice)? General use. I assume it can be used as white rice, so I am not asking you to list how to use it. But are there uses for which it can't be used? Risoto is probably a no-brain example, are there other dishes where the use of black rice will be so bad as to cause the dish to fail?Taste. Is there something very specific about its taste, or is it within the usual variety to be expected from rice?Misc.

      "title": "How to bind chopped pepperoni, salami, and bacon",
      "background": "I have this sandwich I make that I think is pretty good, except that I have a problem with it falling apart. Basically I take sliced salami, sliced pepperoni, (precooked) bacon, and banana peppers and throw them into a food processor to grind it up fairly ground up but not pasty. I then put it in a skillet with some olive oil and brown/crisp it a little and then I add some red wine vinegar and black pepper to taste and set aside. Then I take a loaf of french bread (there's this \"everything\" french bread at my local store that has \"everything\" seasoning on top of it, which I like to use, vs. plain french bread). I cut it in half lengthwise and scoop out some of the inside of the bread. I squirt some horseradish sauce on the bottom side, then add a layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese. Then I add heap of the meat mix, and finally top with another layer of sliced sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese. I then butter the skillet and press the sandwich on the skillet on each side for about a minute (like a cubano). So this is one of my favorite sandwiches to make, and I think it's yummy! The problem is it's a little bit of a pain to eat, because there really isn't anything binding the meat together.So I've been trying to figure out what I can do to make it not fall apart. The first thing I tried is to shred/grate the cheese and mix it in with the meat. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. I assume it's because of the olive oil and vinegar, but I haven't tried outright removing them, as it's a crucial part of the flavor I'm going for. Next time I get a chance to make this sandwich, I was thinking maybe I would try browning the meat without adding the oil/vinegar, and instead sprinkle them on the top while building the sandwich. I figure this might help, but I'm not entirely sure it will completely help, since these meats are a bit fatty in their own right. I was also thinking I could go the route of making it a patty (like making a hamburger patty), where I mix an egg and some breadcrumbs and cook it as a patty. I'm not so sure I really want to do that though. I'm not outright opposed to it, but I already feel like the flavor is where I want it, so I'd like to avoid throwing new flavors into the mix (though admittedly, eggs and breadcrumbs are fairly neutral). But I'm also not sure I dig the idea of a patty for this sandwich in general. I like the mouth feels of heaping mass of chopped meat, and I actually don't mind if there's some amount of \"fall apartness\". I just really want to reduce it a bit somehow. I'm certainly down for experimenting but I'm not by any means even fractionally rich, so I can only indulge in this pleasure about once a month or so, so I was hoping I could maybe see if anybody else out there might have any ideas?If you got this far, thanks for reading my TL;DR!",

As such, if I'm cooking for others, I try and prepare as much as possible in advance to serve food up in a reasonable time. I'd be very grateful if anyone can tell me:How far in advance can I slice/ dice things like onions, celery, carrots etc without it having a detrimental effect on the flavours and textures?Once they are sliced/ diced is it better to refrigerate them or might that make them wet/slimy?If preparing the veg in advance does have a detrimental effect on the flavours and textures, are we talking a small difference that hardly anyone will notice or does it have a dramatic effect?Thanks in advance.",

Most fruits and softer items will be far less forgiving. Potatoes, a relatively hard item tends to oxidize badly, but water dunking tends to fix that with them as well. Items as you mention though, carrots, celery, lettuce, cabbage, any item that is pickled, these type of items tend to be more forgiving. An hour, maybe two, you likely will not notice any loss of quality. Plastic wrap to prevent drying will help and maybe extend this time. Wrapping and then ice or refrigerate, even better for dry items, but for wet items like cucumbers the weeping can be detrimental. With things like onions, garlic and herbs, well I would classify these as aromatics and part of their flavor is being lost anytime you can smell them so I would tend to save them for prep closer to use if possible. If you do need to prep them ahead, I have minced garlic a hour ahead for instance, then tossed it with olive oil that I was going to use in the dish. Please do this short term only though, as raw garlic stored is olive oil is classified by USDA as a salmonella risk. Hour should be fine, days not so much. CANNOTANSWER",

In this case I think the soup needs more liquid in it but I don't want the soup to become to bland. Should I add water to the soup and if so should I just add bouillon crystals (I have chicken and beef) or something else? Also should I defrost the soup then add the noodles/vegetables and cook it in the soup or cook it separately and then add it to the soup?",

As far as cooking the vegetables, it depends on whether there are already pieces of vegetables in the frozen soup. If yes, then you may want to cook your add-ins first so that the stuff that's already in the soup doesn't get mushy. If no, you could cook them in the soup. (However, I have a caveat as far as cooking noodles in broth. When you cook noodles, some of the starch from the pasta transfers into the cooking liquid. This is why pasta water is often used to help with the texture of pasta sauce. If you don't mind having the starch in your soup, you can go ahead and cook the noodles there. If you are bothered by that, cook the noodles separately, drain, and then add them.) CANNOTANSWER",

This has been a problem for me with traditional blenders. I've found that an immersion (stick) blender helps tremendously with this in two specific ways:First, with a stick blender, you are basically holding the blade and can move it around, preventing food from separating and sticking to the sides.Second, most immersion blenders come with small bowl accessories that in essence give you a \"mini blender\". Since the bowl is smaller in size, food separating and sticking to the side isn't as much of an issue. Immersion blenders are pretty cheap -- you can get one for as little as $20. I have the Braun model. It's amazing but I think they stopped making it. The best one on the market now is the KitchenAid.I use mine for hummus, soups and pestos. It's without a doubt one of the most useful tools in my kitchen. CANNOTANSWER",

What is \"5 star spicy\" in the Netherlands, might be \"2 star spicy\" in the midwest USA, for instance.Is there any unambiguous way to discuss the spiciness of a dish?I don't mind if I need to take 5 minutes to explain this method to my mother next time I cook for her, or to the waitress next time I order a Phad Thai. The key is that it must be (mostly) unambiguous in communicating one's preferred level of spice/hotness in a dish.Does such a thing exist?As an analogy, one might describe a beverage's or dessert's sweetness in relation to a commonly-known item, such as table sugar, honey, or even a Coca-Cola. \"I want a sweetened iced tea, but only half as sweet as a Coke.\" While not precise, this is (basically) an unambiguous request.

      "background": "Anyone who likes (or hates) spicy food has been in the situation: You're at a restaurant, your mother-in-law is preparing dinner, or you're preparing dinner for your best friend, and the question comes up: How spicy do you want it?But how can one answer (or ask) this question unambiguously?I'm aware of the Scoville scale, but that applies to a specific (dry) ingredient in a recipe, and not the finished dish (which will typically dilute even the spiciest of peppers).Restaurants often rank dishes from 1-5 \"stars\", \"peppers\", or other units of spiciness, but even this rating system varies greatly by country, region, or even the specific restaurant. What is \"5 star spicy\" in the Netherlands, might be \"2 star spicy\" in the midwest USA, for instance.Is there any unambiguous way to discuss the spiciness of a dish?I don't mind if I need to take 5 minutes to explain this method to my mother next time I cook for her, or to the waitress next time I order a Phad Thai. The key is that it must be (mostly) unambiguous in communicating one's preferred level of spice/hotness in a dish.Does such a thing exist?As an analogy, one might describe a beverage's or dessert's sweetness in relation to a commonly-known item, such as table sugar, honey, or even a Coca-Cola. \"I want a sweetened iced tea, but only half as sweet as a Coke.\" While not precise, this is (basically) an unambiguous request. A similar, common point of reference to use when discussing spiciness would satisfy me.",

I can see how it might be conceived as a duplicate, but I'm not meaning for my question to be. It talks about large cuts of meat and I want to ask about small chunks of meat. I wanted to ask the question on the other post, but since it's four years old, I wasn't sure if it would get read or answered. I have a slow cooker recipe that calls for stew meat to be seared before adding to the slow cooker. I know I can skip that step and have less \"beefy\" stew, but I'd like to have the beef flavor shine. Since I plan to do this in the morning, can I safely sear the chunks of meat ahead of time and immediately refrigerate? Would the same rules that apply to large chunks of meat apply to smaller stew chunks?",

I myself have a collection of porcelain and stoneware presses. What material you choose is really a matter of aesthetics and how you use the press.All of that being said, my experience is that high-quality glass carafes do not break regularly unless you drop them (which is, admittedly, an issue). I'm wondering if you bought a cheaper carafe with inferior glass, like one from Ikea. I have a Bodum which is at least 8 years old.Also, for brand name presses, you can usually buy replacement carafes, since breakage (due to dropping) is a frequent issue. Sometimes the replacements cost as much as a whole new press, but you should at least check it out. CANNOTANSWER",

Pork chops being my canvas of choice for much experimentation.However I'm now stumped as to what I actually do with this thing. I cracked the flimsy shell/skin to expose the sticky fruit inside. I licked it; it tastes good. I'm not sure what to do next though. I've looked at some recipes online, but they all work with tamarind paste. I'm assuming I need to process the meat somehow to turn it into a paste. QuestionsDo I have to turn this into paste? How do I clean/prepare it? (besides obviously throwing the skin away)Do I need to add oil, water, or other ingredients to make it a paste?Are there seeds? Do they need to be removed?",

I skin, slit and marinate the chicken overnight and cook it in a fan forced oven at 180 degrees and turn and baste with the marinade every 15-20 minutes. The problem that I am facing is that the chicken legs take more than an hour to cook and even then there is a little bit on the inside that looks uncooked. If I cook it any longer, the outside is very dry. I had a look at How long and at what temperature do the various parts of a chicken need to be cooked?, but it doesn't help.Can someone provide any usefull tips?",

(It's not like a cookie, which cools quickly enough so that you can (carefully) eat it fresh out of the oven. Pie has plenty of thermal mass.)Besides that, most pies have a filling that will set as it cools. With a fruit pie, the sugary syrupy part will be pretty runny when it's hot, but it'll gel up a bit (like a jam - plenty of fruit and sugar) as it cools.

Here is the method I have used successfully with lobster for years, with a slightly shorter cooking time.Defrost your crab legs first, of course. Gently, in the fridge overnight. Arrange your defrosted crab legs in a heatproof container. Bring enough water to a hard rolling boil to completely cover all of your seafood. (Ensure that the water is salted, of course; as a rule of thumb it should be approximately as salty as the ocean.) After you are at a hard rolling boil, pour the water over the crab legs, cover tightly with foil (or a lid) immediately, and leave alone for seven minutes, eight if the legs are particularly thick. Remove from the water and eat.You may optionally add other ingredients into the container with the crab: dill, fennel fronds, roughly sliced lemons (or any citrus; I love lime with crab), peppercorns, bay leaves, tarragon... the possibilities are functionally endless.

Here is the method I have used successfully with lobster for years, with a slightly shorter cooking time.Defrost your crab legs first, of course. Gently, in the fridge overnight. Arrange your defrosted crab legs in a heatproof container. Bring enough water to a hard rolling boil to completely cover all of your seafood. (Ensure that the water is salted, of course; as a rule of thumb it should be approximately as salty as the ocean.) After you are at a hard rolling boil, pour the water over the crab legs, cover tightly with foil (or a lid) immediately, and leave alone for seven minutes, eight if the legs are particularly thick. Remove from the water and eat.You may optionally add other ingredients into the container with the crab: dill, fennel fronds, roughly sliced lemons (or any citrus; I love lime with crab), peppercorns, bay leaves, tarragon... the possibilities are functionally endless.

One time I tried to hit the chicken in the pan when very hot, and after it looses it up a bit even throw some wine to bring the temperature down make some sauce.

If you prefer to cook it in the pan, then adding the honey should be your last step. Turn off the stove element and drizzle the honey onto the chicken, the residual heat in the pan will take care of the rest. Chicken doesn't release enough fat to make a sauce out of it like you would with a pork or a duck (in reference to making a sauce with the wine). I do this myself with chicken thighs (fattier than chicken breasts, so flavours tend to adhere better), honey, and paprika. Heat the oil in the pan, medium-low. Add sliced onions, sprinkle with salt to release the juices and gently cook until they're soft and caramelized. Rub paprika onto the chicken thighs and add them to the pan. Cook until the juices run clear. Turn off the heat, add the honey, mix it in and let it cool a bit before serving. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "OK, I've been tasked with making a Paleo dessert, and I'd like to try to make a frozen dessert. Here are the ground rules for Paleo desserts: only fermented dairy (yogurt is fine, milk and cream are not), only honey and maybe palm sugar as sweeteners, eggs are fine, nuts are fine, raw coconut oil is fine. I'm thinking it might be possible to combine full-fat yogurt, strained perhaps, with egg yolks and honey, bring it up to 170 to make a custard, then chill, to get something that would freeze acceptably in a standard home ice cream machine. Any suggestions? Would this work? I'd think it would taste good, especially with some chopped almonds and berries mixed in, but I'm worried about texture. What issues will I have with using honey as the sole sweetener? Will there be enough fat in the yogurt?",

If you have a lot of fat in the yogurt then it will be resistant to curdling otherwise you can take out some insurance by mixing in a little bit of corn starch- if that is allowed.Honey is perfectly fine and many frozen yogurt recipes call for it.

      "background": "I am trying to brine a chicken and then cook it in a soup. I just can't seem to do it properly and have noticed varying results for reasons I cannot figure out. My basic method is: add 1.5l spring water to pot, add 30 grams of sea salt and mix until dissolved, add 1kg whole chicken (whole or small pieces), refrigerate for 6-12 hours (usually 12), then cook. I have noticed the following things, please kindly explain why I may be getting varying results and what I may be doing wrong.I notice that if I cut the chicken into eight small pieces these do not brine well at all compared to a 4 piece cut or a whole chicken. This is even after using high salt and plenty of time. When using high salt parts of the chicken come out extremely salty however other parts do not and these parts look raw/red/pink which I think suggests the brine didn't go far enough. I am guessing this is because brining works on chicken surfaces (perhaps this is where the pores are) and with small pieces the inner chicken is exposed. Having said that, most recipes say you can brine small pieces in 1-2 hours. Why doesn't it work for me?Even when I do a whole chicken or 4 pieces, despite giving it 8-12 hours, sometimes there are raw looking parts in the leg pieces, any idea why? Also although the rest of the chicken seems to have been reached i.e. is white although it is not juicy and tender. Any idea why?On one day I brined a chicken with 17 grams salt and only 5 hours, a leg piece came out perfectly, another leg piece OK and the breast didn't. Why on this day did one piece come out great whereas other pieces didn't? Even on other days I double or triple the salt and time yet I haven't been able to get the same result.In thinking about the cause for the above I wondered:does the container need to be air tight to brining to be effective?does water temperature(room/refrigerator/0c) make a difference to actual brining itself?does there have to be plenty of space between chicken parts in the brine or if they overlap a bit? If I use higher salt and what more salt absorption, should I simply leave it to brine longer i.e. longer then 12 hours?Suppose I do a high brine chicken, I then throw away the water and make a new pot with water and say 4 grams of salt, I then add the chicken and cook the soup. Will salt come out of the chicken and go into the water or will it stay in there?Apologise for so many questions, I'm just trying to give as much info as possible. Hope somebody will kindly answer. I brine everyday and can hardly seem to get a good brined leg on any day. In response to peoples comments*Thank you for your responses. To clarify a few things, firstly I am brining and then cooking as a soup(boiling then simmering). I have to do this because I have a stomach ailment and I am intolerant to greasy foods(grill/oven) and stews(due to onion and vegetable intolerance). Strange as it sounds, my stomach is so weak that I am also intolerant to proteins that haven't absorbed a lot of salt e.g. chicken in chicken soup. The only food I can tolerate is protein that is salted quite well e.g. salted, plump, tender and juicy as with brined chicken. This is why I am doing brined chicken soup only! There are no red spots rather after cooking the soup I notice areas/flesh where discoloration(brown, purple,red) is present throughout parts of the flesh. I am sure the chicken is being cooked well(have cooked a lot of soups) however the colours seem more like flesh which the brine hasn't penetrated otherwise it would become white like the rest of the chicken. I have noticed this to be more present when in pieces e.g. small cut chicken or leg pieces rather then breasts.On the next try I will boil my salt first, however I had been stirring with a spoon until all salt visibly dissolved so don't know if this is the cause. I have increased salt for testing purposes, on such days the brining does improve however I still notice the raw looking flesh in certain parts of the chicken.

      "background": "I have a load of dried jalepeno so wish I'd made into chipotle peppers instead - is it possible to rewind time? I was thinking of soaking them then doing a low temp smoke on my grill. Will that get me close or is it just not worth it?UPDATE 2017-09-26A year in, I would not recommend this procedure. Certainly, if you have already dried peppers and want smoky flavor, go ahead, but I've found that the depth of flavor as a result of shorter smoking times is noticeable, and there is an acridity that is present in all but the richest of dishes. Smoke the peppers fresh, if at all possible.EDITDid it. I just used an aluminum pan with lots of holes poked into it. I soaked the chips and the peppers, and I was glad I did. In my Weber charcoal grill I didn't have tons of temp control, and some of them got a little charred even with soaking. On the other hand, I also tried to smoke some fresh peppers, and they didn't dry completely before my coals (and daylight) ran out, so clearly the initial moisture level of the peppers makes a huge difference. I guess I could have stopped and re-soaked them half-way through.I've made some hot sauce with the pre-dried peppers, and it seems like there isn't a ton of smoke coming through, so my final thoughts on this are:If you have lots of dried peppers you want to smoke, do it, but you'll get better flavor if the peppers are fresh.",

My home made smoker uses external heat under a dish of wood shavings sticking out the bottom of the chamber. Chipotles are smoke-dried so you won't get that intense smoke flavour in already dried chillies. They show every sign of keeping indefinitely in an air tight jar, and still hold their shape (though I've crumbled some into flakes). I tend to use them in sauces that are cooked and then served hot (or frozen in between), often with home-smoked garlic as well. Ideally the ratio of smoke flavour to heat would be a little higher next time. More time would help - I probably did a total of about 16-20 hours over two days (it went out overnight). CANNOTANSWER",

So the most important thing is: fail fast. So, for the question of mini batches vs. large batches, you certainly need mini batches. And in cooking it is more important than in other fields, as humans have a very poor ability to remember or record sensory qualities. In tasting two muffins side by side, you will notice differences which would not be obvious from notes from previous batches. Another thing which people find hard to remember: beat the Not Invented Here syndrome! There is a lot of information out there about which ingredient does what, which ratios are good for a given type of baked good, etc. It is boring to research them if you could be baking instead - but in the end, experimenting alone in your kitchen without theoretical background will never give you results as good as those created by teams of specialists who have been doing this their whole life, and using other information sources beyond primary experimentation. So, as with any good research, formulate your question first, and be specific. Then search for answers to this question. Only after you have found the theory, experiment how it applies to your recipe. Randomly changing things and hoping that you will hit gold is what many people do, but it is the opposite of a best practice. CANNOTANSWER",

Some of the oils may get airborne, but the majority of the flavor will stay with the foods. If you want flavor transfer in a steamer you'll need to have the food in direct contact. Sliced chilis and garlic placed on top of a piece of fish will transfer some flavors to the fish, but it's better to contain them by placing them in between 2 pieces of fish/vegetables/meat, or wrapping them up in foil or wax paper.

At 1.5%-2% of the flour weight, salt tightens the gluten network and improves the volume of the finished loaf.\"This means that a less-salted loaf will be denser and less chewy, and an unsalted one even more so. Now, you can knead more to compensate for reduced gluten development, but it still won't be as good. Having baked and eaten bread without salt due to a hung-over cook forgetting to add it to the dough, I can confirm the changes in texture. It also seems to rise differently and overproof faster.

I used a mixer for about 12 minutes until I got a good window pane (though it was still breaking apart a bit, I didn't want to overmix so I stopped).What can I do to make the buns less dense?

The dough should have gotten noticeably bigger during each rise, and if this is the case, there's really no way for them to be dense.If it doubled in the first rise but didn't seem to puff up much by the last rise, your yeast may have simply run out of fuel. To combat this, you can either add a sugar to the dough so the yeast has more food, or cut the rising times a bit so that there's more food for the yeast left in the dough by the last rise.When punching the dough down, be fairly gentle. You want to knock out the excess gas, but you should be leaving some in. For instance, if the dough doubled in size, you'd want to punch it down to about 1.25 to 1.5 times the original size, not all the way down.I wouldn't add baking powder to these. Most of the rising potential of the baking powder will be spent long before they're ready to go in the oven.

      "background": "Yesterday, I got a cast-iron skillet, and the first thing I did was try to season it. I washed it vigorously with soap and water, then rinsed it for several minutes.After drying it with a paper towel, I put it on the stove and started up flame on the medium setting. Then I took a brush, which I used to cover the entire (hot) cookware surface with oil. By this time, my oven had been preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and I put the skillet in for 30 minutes.After taking it out and letting it cool, I found that the patina looked terribly sticky, and I could still see and feel the coarse original cast-iron finish.A bit of research revealed that this is because (i) because I used too much oil and (ii) because olive oil isn't good for seasoning. Oh well. I washed it out (soap and water), dried it, and placed it on medium heat for 10 minutes so that it wouldn't rust. I turned the heat off after 10 minutes, and went to bed to try it again with canola oil today. To my shock, I found the following on my skillet (two pictures of the same skillet). Look at the edges of the dark spots to see what I mean:Is this rust? Or is it some strange transition material between the seasoning patina and the cast-iron? How did this get there, and what can I do about this (in the present to fix and in the future to prevent)?Additional questions (I'm a beginner, so I have a few):Do I need to remove what looks like a partial olive oil seasoning layer from the skillet?What oil should I use for the new seasoning? At what temperature should I heat it?Should my skillet be room temperature when I apply the oil? Should my skillet be in the oven when the oven is preheating?Does heating the skillet after washing and applying a bit of oil to it before storage promote rancidity?",

How hard did you scrub?I use vegetable oil and use only about a teaspoon for the inside cooking surface and sides. Another teaspoon for the outside and underside and handle. You really don't want too much oil or it will become sticky because it hasn't broken down fully, which is probably what happened with your first attempt. I imagine your skillet was already pre-seasoned anyway.To fix it, heat the pan on the cooker for a bit, then reapply the oil in a thin layer with a piece of kitchen towel, and use another clean kitchen towel to wipe away any excess. The pan should be hot but not searing, the heat apparently helps open the pores of the metal. The surface shouldn't look wet or have wet spots. It should have a sheen to it.Put it in the oven, upside down, on the maximum temperate (around 240c or 450f) for an hour or longer. When you pull it out, it should be seasoned nicely. The surface won't have a sheen anymore, and it shouldn't be sticky to the touch once it's cool.You can repeat the process a few times if you think it needs it. CANNOTANSWER",

They work perfectly but recently I have been having a problem cleaning them.I let them sit for a few days after using them without cleaning them, because I was too lazy - no excuses here.Then I got to scrubbing. I scrubbed them thoroughly with dishwashing liquid and even though they were completely clean they still smelled foul. So I scrubbed them again with antibacterial soap, thinking bacteria began to thrive from the decomposing meat and somehow clung to the bag, but they still smell bad.Before I used to use the same kind of bag but bought from a different seller. The \"model\" was exactly the same, save that both sides of the bag were smooth. The ones I am currently using have one of the inside sides sort of \"ribbed\" with tiny horizontal and vertical grooves. I had no problem cleaning my old bags but now I can't seem to be able to get rid of the smell of these ones.The smell wouldn't be bothering me so much if I knew it was safe to reuse them but I'm thinking it might harm the food if I cook it in them.Am I correct in assuming so and, in either event, how should I get rid of the smell?Just to be clear my main point is I am asking how to best clean my bags not if it's safe to reuse them.",

However, you are still left with the smell.Some plastics will absorb odors and it can be quite unpleasant. My go to for any issue with odors in plastic is baking soda. It works well in absorbing these odors and getting them out of the plastic material. I would suggest placing some baking soda inside the bags and closing them up. Let them sit for a few hours or overnight. Discard the baking soda, then rinse well and dry thoroughly. If there is a small amount of residual odor, you can repeat the process. At the most, twice should definitely take care of it. CANNOTANSWER",

The same goes for whatever filling you are using, if you would regularly use flour as a thickening agent try corn starch or a gluten free flour instead. It's important to remember, however, that many gluten free flours do not bind as easily as wheat flour, and thus you may need to use more butter than usual.EDITPierogi dough, when made from scratch, dries very quickly, even moreso with gluten free flour. Be sure to cover the unused dough with a bowl and only take small chunks out at a time while you are forming and filling your pierogi.Source: Was taught to make pierogi by an elderly Polish woman in my youth, have a niece and sister with celiac's disease CANNOTANSWER",

What are some tips to make dicing a tomato a little easier? I finally got a very sharp knife which has made things quite a bit easier, but I imagine there is some sort of correct technique.Using romas I usually will slice the ends off and then cut them into rings. Then I'll take about 1/3 of those stacked up and cut them into cubes.",

          "context": "Cut the tomato in half at the midsection or equator (stem end being the \"north pole\") to expose the seed cavities. Holding the cut side down over your garbage bowl or trash can, gently squeeze to remove the seeds. You can easily pry out stubborn seeds with your fingertips.Place the tomato half cut-side up on the cutting board (Cutting waxy skinned vegetables is much easier when the skin is on the bottom so the force of the knive cuts cleanly through the skin with less effot) and cut in half again. After doing this with both pieces the tomato will be in quarters. If you want evenly diced pieces of just the exterior flesh (such as for sprinkling on a plate for a garnish), then use your knife to cut out the interior portion so that just the tomato \"shell\" remains. You can then easily dice the exterior shell.Otherwise, after cutting into quarters just gently push down to flatten each quarter and cut into strips lengthwise and then cut cross-wise to finish the process.While cumbersome to explain in text, it's much safer and quicker than cutting the tomato into slices and then trying to dice from there.

However, as a general guideline, I would suggest that you look at the bread as just another ingredient in the dish -- not as somehow distinct from the filling choices. Like any other ingredient pairing, you can evaluate the characteristics and choose things to complement each other. So if you pick your bread first, evaluate if it's rich or mild, savoury or sweet, dense or light, crusty or soft, thin or thick, etc, and then choose fillings to complement those properties. For your fillings, there's not only the flavour pairing of the filling and the bread to consider, but also the texture/properties of the filling. A dry filling might not be as pleasant on a dense bread because the texture would be too much the same. Similarly, a saucy filling needs an appropriate bread selection to contain it and make it easy to eat.Many pairings that are considered standard will just taste \"good\" to us because of tradition and familiarity, but originally, someone probably put them together for a reason. That doesn't mean it's not worth trying something different, though.

          "context": "If your espresso machine has a milk steamer then you have several options; you can make a vanilla simple syrup with vanilla pod scrapes added and add that directly to your espresso, you can make a vanilla sugar which will be much milder, you can scrape some vanilla in with your milk as you steam it which produces a wonderful smell, you can add organic vanilla extract to your milk or simple sugar although I like the pods better. You could just buy the French Vanilla flavor they sell but it always seems sweeter than what you get in the coffee house by the cup.Adding vanilla extract to the cup will not bring out the aromatics you need to add it to the steamed milk.Why buy vanilla syrup when you can make your own? Especially when you can control the instensity of the vanilla. Vanilla ground coffee beans are great as long as you don't sweeten your coffee. IMHO flavored coffee beans are only worth it if you take your coffee unadulterated. If you don't have a milk steamer go buy one because you cannot make decent cappuccino without it, but most espresso machines have one so I am going to assume you already have it. CANNOTANSWER",

I would recommend about 250-275F (121-135C) as a cooking temperature. It should take about 2 hours, give or take, depending on the thickness of your steaks. Hit them up with some dry rub or salt and pepper prior to cooking. Put the steaks on the smoker, and start checking on them at about the 1.5 hour mark. You don't want to make pulled beef, so when you put a probe or skewer through the steak, it should go through with a little resistance (unlike when you are making pulled pork, for example, where you want to feel absolutely no resistance when you slide the probe through the meat). When you think the steaks are about done, paint them with your favorite sauce, if you like, and leave them on the smoker for another 15 minutes or so.It's a little more nuanced than smoking a whole shoulder, but not enough to be intimidating. You want the finished product to be nearly fork tender, but not falling apart. However, err on the side of cooking too long, versus not enough, and you'll be happy. CANNOTANSWER",

You don't want to make pulled beef, so when you put a probe or skewer through the steak, it should go through with a little resistance (unlike when you are making pulled pork, for example, where you want to feel absolutely no resistance when you slide the probe through the meat). When you think the steaks are about done, paint them with your favorite sauce, if you like, and leave them on the smoker for another 15 minutes or so.It's a little more nuanced than smoking a whole shoulder, but not enough to be intimidating. You want the finished product to be nearly fork tender, but not falling apart. However, err on the side of cooking too long, versus not enough, and you'll be happy. CANNOTANSWER",
