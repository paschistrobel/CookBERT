What additional information could I provide?Edit: I can rule out oyster sauce. I asked in a restaurant what the black stuff was, but either she didn't understand me or she didn't want to (all she told me was that it contained salt). Finally she said she made it herself. Anyway, I bought Hoisin sauce:and I think it's as close as it gets (perhaps the restaurant uses a slightly different version of the one I bought, as mine is a bit saltier and a bit less sweet).Update: I finally discovered the exact sauce I was looking for.

Indeed, you want to initially be cooking the steak at a higher-than-normal temperature in order to sear it, but I'd suggest a period of more like 30 seconds each side, followed by slightly longer at a reduce temperature. At 650 degrees, the steak does not need long to sear. The same principle has worked for me when pan-frying steak, though obviously at much lower temperatures.I'm not sure how large a role the salting is playing, but I would only salt the steak minimally before cooking. It's often just as well done towards the end of cooking, and is less likely to dry out the steak.In addition, a common mistake is to pat down the steaks too much while (or after) cooking them. This may speed up the process slightly, but it certainly dries out the meat (the outside in particular). This is probably not the main problem, but is worth noting anyway.Hope that helps.

Otherwise only the bottom gets blended while the top stays solid. Food processors usually have a flat bottom and have a mechanism to turn the food as it cuts it up. This results in evenly chopped food.If you want the gazpacho to end up completely smooth, then the blender will definitely work in this application as it will be liquid enough to get the funnel action going to mix the food around. Keep it mind it would be a good idea to start blending the vegetables with high water content such as tomato and onion first to create a liquid \"base\" for the other vegetables.IF you want coarse chunks for the vegetables, it is slightly trickier but still possible to use a blender. You need to work in smaller \"batches\" and use the pulse functionality instead of just blending. If the batch is too big, you end up with overblended mush on the bottom and unblended chunks on top.

But as far as I can see it from the picture, these are not worms at all. Beans and related plants have an embryo in their seeds. In white legumes, the embryo is a light pink color and looks indeed like a larva. The way to check is to look at the still-intact beans. They are all made up of two symmetrical halves inside. Cut them open through the plane which separates the two halves. If they have your suspect at the concave part of the bean, where it used to attach to the pod, then this is the embryo, just a normal part of the seed which is supposed to grow into a new plant when planted. If the embryo of multiple beans looks differently from that (or is too small to notice), then these may be larvae after all. In this case, you will probably choose to discard the food because of the disgust factor. It is still not objectively unsafe. CANNOTANSWER",

Usually I end up with some leftover dough, which I stick in the fridge and then try to make into buns or something for breakfast the next morning.

It doesn't seem to brown nicely, and the texture is sometimes a bit strange for what I expect from a bun. I'm wondering if it's something inherent in the style of dough used for pizza crust or something I'm inadvertently doing with the pizza dough that I wouldn't do with regular dough (maybe using too little, not letting it warm up enough, not enough rising time)?Here's the dough recipe that I tried this with most recently. So, is pizza dough just too different from bread dough, or is there something I can do to make my leftover dough usable for something other than more pizzas?",

It makes sense, since I thought that those grains could be small curdles of protein. Also, by having a smaller ratio of sugars, it could be that less caramelization (which is important for the texture) occurs.So, before I start experimenting and wasting food, I would like to know if anyone knows a way to make this work.My first guess is to increase the ph a bit by mixing some baking soda before heating as it may inhibit the formation of curdles. On the other hand, maybe just adding more sugar could help, but these things already are damn sweet, it seems wrong to put even more sugar into it!Any insights on this?",

And we should find a do-it-yourself solution which does not involve particular equipment or materials.A way to preserve cotton candy is to freeze it, but obviously you have to eat it frozen, or it will melt.We thought of two other ways:Use hot hair to reduce the amount of water in the box, and then seal the box. I am not a supporter of this idea, because I believe that hot air will just melt the cotton candy (and I do not think that humidity will be reduced that much).Use CO2, which can be easily and cheaply fabricated at home (vinegar + sodium bicarbonate). Since it should be heavier than air, one could produce it in a large container, then pour the CO2 in the box containing the cotton candy, and then seal it. I think that CO2 will replace air in the box and this will reduce the amount of humidity, allowing conservation of the food.What do you think? Have you ever tried something similar?

If you want it strong but don't use enough ground coffee, you can get more flavour by leaving the water on the grounds for longer. But then the bitter flavours come out. The opposite is espresso; a decent espresso is of course strong but not at all bitter and extraction is quick. Another factor may be that some of the bitter compounds come out early but are masked or made acceptable by the other flavoursWater temperature also plays a role in which components of the flavour are extracted, but I assume that's fixed.

You need to reheat the air in the oven after the cookies go in for them to cook. Because the hot walls and rack are much smaller (and probably not as well heated to start with), it's harder for them to reheat the inside of the oven. So the temperature is lower when you start the cookies. Some (maybe a lot) of the cooking time is spent getting the oven, the baking sheet and the air back up to temperature. Cooking them longer or at a slightly hotter temperature should help with this. CANNOTANSWER",

In my opinion, mayonnaise is completely unsuitable for high-temperature processing (as in baking), but I was unable to come up with a substitute for it.So, my question is, what can we put into cake batter instead of mayonnaise?Update: I think mayonnaise is unsuitable for baking because it is an emulsion which separates into its ingredients when heated, emulsifying agents used in a commercial mayo are not particularly healthy, and mayonnaise does not taste any good when it is broken into its components.The components of the batter are: 6 table spoons of flour, 3 eggs, 200gram mayo, 200gram sour cream. The components of the filling are: chopped prepared chicken meat, chopped sauteed onions, boiled eggs, etc.",

You can add a little vinegar for flavor. :) CANNOTANSWER",

In the past I've done grilled chicken breast on the side, but is there a way to make it a one pot meal or serve with another meat main so I'm not limited to chicken? Ideally I'd like to feature the flavors of the pasta as the main.I tried hot Italian sausage last night. It was OK, but I felt that the sausage competed too much with the flavors of the dressing.",

The texture is fine. I stopped eating it but wondering what this is about. I cut it in half while it was still raw and washed the knife and then used it for salad ingredients. If the knife wasn't washed well enough could the raw salmon cause me a problem? Thanks!Edit: Does anyone know what the taste might mean? Or if it might mean it's not really edible?

Now I want to go the next step and make my own blend.I've got a recipe I want to try and have bought all the ingredients I need in whole form. I'm wondering if there is any advantage in grinding them up. This answer on this site leads me to believe that it's workable to leave spices whole, but I feel like that wouldn't be the case with a whole nutmeg nut. Surely the flavour would not be accessed by boiling water in such a hard and thick nut?I also learned that in the case of tea, it's actually inadvisable to boil or steep them for too long, as it releases bitter tannins. So I wonder if grinding down spices to \"release\" more flavour might also have adverse affects.So, bottom line, maybe you can boil spices whole, but maybe it's better to chop or grind them a little? And if so, how far should one take it?",

In this way you can control the strength of flavor in the final product if all of the spices are added at once.I've not been able to find any reference to boiling a spice for an extended period changing the character of the flavor(just the potency) which makes sense for a spice since we usually eat the whole thing in ground form anyway.The same does not apply to herbs.

Unfortunately I didn't get the details, so I haven't dared try it myself. I was wondering if someone here had done this or something similar, and could describe the methode (especially temperature and timing) to me - and confirm that this actually work and give a good result.The idea was to take a whole (or half would do?) chicken (I assumed plucked, cleaned and ready for cooking), and cover it with salt! You would basically take lots of salt and add a little water, so you got a thick \"goo\" of salt. Then you would cover the chicken with this salt-goo in a thick layer. Then you would put the salt-goo covered chicken in the oven to bake. In the oven, the salt-goo would become a thick salt-crust, that would trap in the moisture. When finished, you just crack the salt-crust open.Does this actually work?! I can't help but thinking that the result would be a very salty chicken...",

Work in the salt and any other flavors before placing the curd in the mold.I imagine any herb or spice would work- it depends what flavor you want. I have used basil when I had a bumper crop. I have also used dried peppers.As to dry or fresh- either would work. As with anything if you use dry then use a lot less. I prefer fresh because it is more tender.Other cheeses might be a little different but as a rule of thumb adding with the salt should work. Mozzarella seems like it would be trickier because the kneading of the curd would change things. CANNOTANSWER",

The moisture provided by oil will not evaporate during cooking and even after the product is cooled to room temp, the liquid fat remain and provide a moist crumb.

I've already learned to toss the sodium seasoning packet to avoid the salt, but I notice the noodles themselves have lots of fat and much of it saturated.

In an attempt to reduce the fat content, I dump the water after the noddles are cooked and add more water to start up a new broth. (For reference, I add Thai red curry seasoning and either an egg, canned salmon or both. If I have one, I'll squeeze a lime over the finished product.)Does it help reduce the fat content of the meal if I dump the initial broth? Is there any way to know how effective the practice is?",

An egg is ~6g fat, ~2g saturated. The fish is ~27g fat, ~6g saturated. Check your red curry seasoning as well (varies a lot by brand/type) So it seems like your approach is misguided, but nutrition questions are off-topic here.edit: From thinking about your comment, you may want to try switching to spaghetti. You can just break it until it fits in the bowl, and it should be cookable in a bowl in the microwave, or even soaking in boiling water. You won't get perfect al dente or anything close, and my Italian ancestors will be after me for even suggesting this, but it will cut down on the fat. You can even get whole-wheat spaghetti.

But now I am using an electric cooking range that uses a gas cylinder. It has a knob to adjust the temperature and an option to grill. And inside it has holders at three different heights to place the tray. I don't know the exact word to describe my cooking system. Anyway all I want to know is what should be done to make the exact cake recipe which I tried in micro+convection mode at 200 degree?For what duration should I bake and at which height should I place the tray?",

          "context": "A range (also knows as cooker in some places) is a free-standing kitchen appliance with a cooktop (hob) on the top and an oven below. The oven sounds like a conventional gas oven and not a fan assisted (convection) oven. An oven will give you much better cakes than a microwave, you just need to get used to how your oven cooks. Most recipes are written to be used in an oven and not a microwave convection oven, so for cooking times and temperatures you should simply go back to the recipe temperature and time for a guide. If the recipe is not available then you will need to do some trial and error. 200C seems a bit high to me, you could end up burning the outside and having the inside overdone. Many cakes are baked between 160 to 180C depending on the type and thickness, so for a conventional (non-fan) oven I would split that down the middle and go for 170C, (155 for a fan oven) and up the cooking time to 20-30 minutes. Try the middle rack your first time cooking in the oven. One thing I would recommend is getting an oven thermometer. Many ovens, especially older ones, do not cook at the temperature you set, and can be much hotter or colder than you want leading to bad results. An oven thermometer will tell you how hot your oven actually is inside so you can set it properly. CANNOTANSWER",

THis leaves a lot of leftover whey which we used to just throw out. This past week I took my first swing at making mozzarella, and noticed that the recipe suggested not throwing out the whey, but rather using it to make ricotta by boiling it. I ended up throwing out the whey from the mozzarella anyways because it was a tiny batch, and we had to make yogurt anyway.So, we made the yogurt, and my girlfriend saved they whey for me. I've been simmering it for a few minutes now, and it doesn't appear to be working. Nothing is curdling. I'm wondering if its a function of not having anything acidic in it? I tried adding a quarter teaspoon of citric acid, but still nothing is curdling. At this point I'm curious to play with it, so I may try simmering it all the way down into gjetost. So really i guess my question is, outside of being less acidic, is whey from making yogurt different from whey from cheese making?Also as a note, we use 1% milk.",

The casein proteins are bound up with some of the lactose and almost all the fat to make the curd. The whey for such cheeses contains the rest of the lactose, tons of vitamin B, and almost all the albumin.The albumin proteins are water soluble when they haven't been denatured. They also denature at a higher temperature than the casein does. Therefore, they almost all wash out of the curd with the whey. Bringing mozzarella whey to a (almost) boil denatures the albumin which precipitates out and can be strained to make ricotta.When making yogurt the milk is heated to 190 or higher and then cooled. This is precisely to denature the albumin. The extra protein gives the yogurt a lot more structure.

To combine the liquids (milk, eggs, vanilla) with the solids (dark brown sugar, butter, flour) it called for combining the solids over medium heat, cooking it until the sugar was completely melted, and then combining with the liquids.Now, my candy experience starts and stops at \"things containing chocolate\", but I can melt sugar. However with the addition of butter and flour I was worried about it burning, and I didn't render it all the way down to full on molten sugar. It was quite melted but it poured more like a thin batter than like liquid sugar.Combined the liquid(y) sugar with the liquids, and exactly what I thought would happen, happened: the sugar immediately solidified into chunks, and wouldn't incorporate. Rescued it by heating the whole thing, and stirring until it incorporated. This worked, but I think it sent the texture off a bit.My question is: is this even feasible? Can you really melt sugar to a thin liquid, and then seamlessly incorporate it with a cold liquid? And wouldn't the addition of flour cause issues with cooking the sugar? I pretty much expected it not to work, so it may just have been a failure of will on my part.",

Got the sugar hot enough to pour in thin streams, put the liquid ingredients in a stand mixer on low, and slowly drizzled the sugar into the mixer. Combined reasonably well, well enough at least, that I didn't feel like I had to heat it further. So it is possible. It really only worked though because the proportion of hot sugar to cold ingredients left a final mixture that was warm enough to keep the sugar suspended.However the pie was pretty much exactly the same, and the process was much more involved than just lumping all the ingredients in a pan over low heat, and warming gently until they combined.So, in conclusion, you can do it, but I don't know why you'd want to.

My mother usually makes a cold salad the day after with some Cocktail sauce (with ketchup as the tomato sauce), a few varieties of canned fish (mackerel, sardines and anchovy) and some boiled eggs.The problem is that this rice always turns out somewhat dry, somewhat detracting from the overal quality of the product. It's still edible and tastes good, but the textures are somewhat lacking in my opinion.I have read \"Instant\" leftover rice? Making leftover-like rice without the wait? (as in for fried rice), but that's not what I need: I don't have control over the cooking process, and it's not for reheating afterwards. I also don't think this falls under the generic shelf live question, because this isn't about how long it will last, but how to store it short-term so certain negative effects don't occur, for which I cannot find a question (nor a tag).I'm looking for a method to cool the rice without it turning dry that doesn't involve special attention immediately afterwards or changing the cooking process. With \"doesn't involve special attention\", I'm talking about something someone can do while unpacking the rest of the food and maybe putting a bit of the rice aside for those that don't like the fried kind.",

Here's what I recommend.Immediately upon returning home with your takeout, remove the rice from the take out container, placing in an equal size airtight container. E.g., if you have one pint of rice, place in a pint container. Don't break the rice apart any more than necessary. Press the rice so that it holds tight together in the container just as it was when you removed it from the takeout container. Put the lid on right away. Refrigerate to store.By placing in an airtight container right away, you are shortening the amount of time that moisture can evaporate. By using the same size container there shouldn't be an excessive amount of airspace in the container.I follow this procedure and the rice comes out the next day just like it went in, still moist. Plus it doesn't really require any excessive time or effort. CANNOTANSWER",

In general, you don't want it to happen at all. If you miss your timing and it happens, re-roll. But the proper way to do it is to roll each piece separately, directly before dropping it in the pan. This gives you the optimal effects from the flour with minimal change in taste. If you want the benefits and taste of a thick crust, make a real schnitzel, including pounding the meat thin and making several alternating layers of egg and flour in the crust.

I tend to think that, being ceviche mainly raw seafood, this is just a myth coming from times when fridges were not available, but locals were very assertive about the inconveniences of eating raw seafood for dinner. They referred sleeping disorders, and the such. So two questions:Anybody knows if the Peruvian massive opinion is shared with other people on the Pacific Rim? Is it really a myth?If the previous was affirmative ... Is it reasonable to store the day's catch outside a fridge (but in a shadowy and fresh place) to be eaten raw at dinner?

Sugar Substitute with Stevia as main ingredient can be used but you need to inquire to what ratios you would need to use your specific brand with.Acesulfame Potassium is heat stable but is 200 times sweeter than regular sugar. The general rule of thumb I was taught is 1 gram per quarter cup of sugar.Sucralose: Granulated sucralose can be used as an equal-volume substitute for sugar. (Raw sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar, so you'd use less, but the granulated form contains fillers to bring it up to the normal volume.) There may be some considerations in making ice cream with this as when using this for baking the baking process is accelerated to a certain degree. Be careful with this one.Saccharin and Aspartame should be avoided because they are heat sensitive. Other more natural sugar substitutes include honey, fruit juice concentrates and refined fructose.

          "context": "Generally, slow-cooking means any food preparation method which relies on using low-heat for a long amount of time. Barbecues, smokers, luau pits, and low-heat ovens could all qualify. The benefit of slow-cooking, generally, is that food becomes incredibly tender, as all of its connective tissues break down. Also, flavor can infuse over time and provide deeper results than with virtually any other method. Lastly, long-cooking times create a celebratory atmosphere where food is the focal point of a social gathering.Specifically, slow-cooking refers to the 'slow-cooker' a counter-top set-up which has a large, electronically heated ceramic bowl and a glass lid. It usually has only a few settings, such as 'low', 'medium', and 'high'. The benefit of slow-cooking in a slow-cooker is mainly convenience. These units are safe enough to turn on before work and return to before dinner, with fully-cooked, piping hot food ready to go. The slow-cooker is geared towards 'one-pot' recipes, which means they require minimal food preparation. You simply cut up the ingredients in fairly large chunks, add seasoning, and liquid, and that's it. They are a favorite of working parents, but increasingly, also a device for more advanced experimentation. CANNOTANSWER",

The recipe is basically just apples and pears, red onions, raisins, brown sugar, cider vinegar and various spices which you simmer gently for a couple of hours. It says nothing about straining or grinding. The onions are finely sliced and it says \"chop apples and pears roughly but without coring.\"Does the vinegar somehow soften the seeds and core of the apple? Is that important to the taste or texture? I am hesitant to used the whole apple as most recipes I have found online say to core or even peel and core.",

Another is the reverse, use more mix, which uses two packets (if not all of the second is necessary, you might share with someone else who wants extra, save it for next time, or simply discard).Third option would be to add a pinch of salt. It can help balance the flavors (a pinch isn't enough to make it not-sweet), and it's commonly described that less salt can make something taste \"watery\", and adding a touch of salt makes things taste more balanced. It will change the flavor a bit, but not necessarily badly.Fourth option is to add stuff. Sugar, creamer powder, spices (possibly brought from home), whatever pleases you - and some of which might already be present for doctoring coffee. Any of these options should add some flavor, changing the taste but perhaps not badly. I wouldn't recommend milk, since (as you mention) it has enough liquid it can dilute the flavors, but powdered flavorings might help (and not dilute). Or you might even try keeping on hand a candy to dissolve in your drink (peppermint round, wrapped caramel) the heat and water should let it dissolve a burst of flavor into your drink. Again, flavored, but not necessarily bad. CANNOTANSWER",

With reds let the glass stand for 10 minutes or so after pouring to get the optimal temperature. 2 weeks out of the fridge and it's probably vinegar, but if it still takes ok you can cook with it no problem.

A chorreador is functionally similar to a pour over, but the cloth filter will likely have different characteristics.I've read that the grind should be \"fine to medium-fine\", and I imagine the specifics are left to taste and depend on other characteristics (roast, amount of beans, etc.). I will tune my grind based on some experimentation, but what are the characteristics I should be looking for? In general, how does coarseness or fineness affect the coffee profile? What characteristics should I expect to vary?Are there particular characteristics that are \"bad\" and I should tune to avoid (for example, I've heard the silt in coffee can be hard on digestion)?I'm not looking for an answer to \"how fine should I grins my coffee?\", but rather what are the parameters I should look for when experimenting with the grind?",

Too fast, and you don't get the right flavours and too slow and you'll get off and bitter tastes.With a setup like the one you describe you can't change the speed the water passes through coffee (unlike espresso, for example) so you control how long water spends with your coffee (and the surface area of contact) by the size of the grind. The water will tend to stay and mud up super fine grinds. If you were to try to filter through turkish grind, you'd be waiting a long time and might taste something harsh.Too coarse of a grind and the water will run through and not pick up enough (low extraction).Aside from colour, taste and aroma, what you are looking for is how long it takes for water to pass through the coffee grind. I can't tell you how long for your specific setup, but if you're going slower than 20 seconds per ounce of water, it's likely too fine of a grind. Also note that the longer water spends with coffee, the more caffeine it'll pick up.Finally, if you can, keep an eye on the drips as they leave the filter. When the drop or stream is no longer cloudy and starts looking clear, that's about when you've extracted what you can with that grind (both amount and coarseness). CANNOTANSWER",

This is due to the cruncy exterior coating absorbing moisture from inside the food combined with moisture being trapped inside the wrapping/storange container which then is absorbed by the food as well. It happens even shortly after frying if the food item is placed on a flat surface where the inner steam can't escape and is trapped between the food and the surface under it. This is why when frying large batches or holding fried food for any extended time, it's best to drain on a cooling rack that's upside down on a brown paper bag or paper towels. Upside down so that it's close to the paper to absorb excess grease but still allows a small bit of airspace so that steam can escape and if keeping it in a warm oven, hot air can circulate.You can re-crisp your chicken by placing it on a roasting/cooling rack on a baking tray and place in the oven to re-crisp the skin.

Then you have synthetic vanilin, which comes as a white powder or in tiny vials of propylene-glycol solution. As it is very concentrated, it ends up being much cheaper than the extract, but its smell is nowhere as rich as that of real vanilla extract. I suppose that you could also use real vanilla pods. I would cut off a piece, cut it open, and place it within the ground coffee during brewing (if you think it will interfere too much, you can also just scratch out the seeds and use them, but you will be throwing out lots of vanilla that way). I have never done it, so I don't know how big a piece you will need for the taste to be reasonably strong. I suspect that using vanilla extract will be more economical, as vanilla usually needs time to give off aroma, and the short espresso brewing time, even with the pressure, will need a fairly large chunk to make a difference in taste. Still, the pressure-brewed vanilla will have a different taste profile than the alcohol-dissolved vanilla extract, so if you are not happy with the taste the extract gives, this is one more method to try out.

If you don't insist on the chicken itself being crisp, and just need the texture, you can bread the chicken with breadcrumbs, or froth it with batter. Breading is the usual option and works well with pieces shallow fried in a pan, such as chicken breasts or boneless backs. If you are making a whole chicken, you'll have to be creative, and frothing may work better.

In some cases, like a coffee cake, sour cream or yogurt can account for a good amount of the moisture and fat in the batter. Rich dairy products like cream and sour cream usually lead to very tender baked goods, due to helping to incorporate more fat (the fact that it's already emulsified helps too). Soured dairy, like yogurt, sour cream, and buttermilk are frequently used so that their acidity will react with baking soda in the recipe for leavening.Finally, yogurt and buttermilk often have stabilizers like guar gum, xanthan gum, and carrageenan. These will retain moisture after baking to help the finished product be more moist. Whether a substitution will work would depend on which functions the dairy ingredient is filling, and which characteristics the substitute matches. CANNOTANSWER",

You can also make your butter warmer- short of burning it- to give yourself more time. You can replace some of the melted butter with oil.Once the batter is assembled at room temperature there is less risk of the butter separating. Therefore, mixing the wet and dry ingredients before the butter can solidify is useful. In this case the flour would slightly warm the milk.However you do it, making pancake batter ahead of time is generally a bad idea because the chemical leavening in the batter will activate and be expended.

For kidneys, this step serves a very simple purpose: to remove any trace of the animal's bodily fluids. Recipes often call for soaking foie gras, liver, and sweetbreads in milk. It is often said that milk improves the taste, purges blood, lightens the color, or affects some other property of the meat. We were skeptical, so we tried several experiments. With a mild-flavored organ meat like foie gras, we could taste a difference, but, frankly, in our tests, we prefer the taste of water-soaked to milk-soaked foie gras. With stronger-flavored organ meats, there is even less of a difference than with foie gras. So our suggestion is to simply soak the meat in water. So, there you have it. CANNOTANSWER",

She lives about an hour and a half away, and I will be walking and taking public transportation to get there. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips for convenient ways to tranport the food?

You can buy soft-sided insulated bags with straps - I see them in the grocery store - that should be ok for a trip of that length. I buy frozen food and then drive home for an hour with it, put it straight in the freezer, and would laugh at the thought of there being food-safety issues with that. So one approach is to make a lasagna, casserole, or the like in a disposable container, freeze it at home, take it to your relative's and put it in her freezer. Now she has a semi-quick (but at least easy) meal waiting for her.(A side note from remembering my days with an infant: something that heats up FAST and can be eaten with one hand will be more useful than a serves-12-needs-a-fork-heats-for-an-hour option.

I heated the cast iron skillet good and hot, browned the roast, poured a can of tomato paste onto it with a can of french onion soup and some fresh garlic and coarse pepper and popped the whole shebang into the oven at 375.It all broke down when I let a project get me side-tracked and now I need to save my bacon (or beef as is the case now).So, now I'm wondering something. I want to take this lovely, dry roast and crock-pot it with honey and molasses for a spicy-sweet fajita masterpiece before she gets home tomorrow and I'm looking for a recipe.Now, mind you, I need to be at work 70 miles from home at 7:00 in the morning but I've got 2 teenage boys that can babysit the crock-pot. I'll have some time to put this together before heading out the door.Any spicy-sweet ideas out there?Thanks in advance!Edit An excellent point was made in the comments: How bad is it?The Roast pulls apart readily, is quite brown and very dry tasting. The french onion soup and tomato reduced down to a very caramelized reduction in the bottom of the pan leaving the top of the roast exposed for about an hour. Although, I did have a cast iron lid on the whole rig so it didn't 'burn' completely.",

I'm doing a 1:1 substitution using the guide on the carton (1egg is approx. 2oz), so I assume that a lot of the problem is that I'm missing the fat from the egg yolks.

Since you've omitted the fat there is probably a bit more gluten formation taking place and thus the fact that it doesn't rise as well. Egg whites have a drying effect on baked goods so that is why the bread is drier than before. CANNOTANSWER",

Aside from the fact that I've been cooking for myself for decades, and I'm still here, we simply wouldn't be here as a species if it were that hard to cook safely. And then there's this thread from a couple of years ago, which seems to say that there's a fair amount of subjectivity in food safety procedures.

Are there rules that are just oversimplifications in order to minimize human error? UpdateThis is not a duplicate of this question.

Inosinate is one such salt. Proteins need to be broken down (cooked) to release the glutimates. I have not been able to find a minimum temperature or time, but it is clear that cooking is necessary. However, you should also keep in mind that the umami flavor in a chicken stock comes from multiple sources, as vegetables also contain glutimates.Cooking a chicken for 45 minutes in a pressure cooker will clearly result in over-cooked chicken. In terms of the release of glutimates, a pressure cooker does not appear to be more advantageous than a traditional pot. It certainly makes the production of stock quicker.I would suggest three options: (a) save chicken scraps (bones, necks, wing tips, etc) for the specific purpose of making stock, and don't worry about over cooking the chicken, just make a good stock, (b) same as suggestion (a) except purchase less expensive legs (for example) to make stock, or (c) poach a chicken to your desired doneness and use the poaching liquid as a stock...or as the liquid portion of a more rich stock as a second step.

Having seen the questions about oil reuse and conservation, I'm still at a loss about what's going on with my oil...My sunflower oil foams like crazy. I've been reusing this oil for a while now and was going to discard it, however a friend of mine told me this oil was still looking good. Relatively clean (I filter it regularly), no off smell and it doesn't smoke (in my fryer, that is). I only fry potatoes in this batch of oil to avoid flavor transfer. These are cut into French fries, chips or straw potatoes. Specially the chips and straws retain a lot of water, and I guess that has something to do with it.Also, I noticed the frying takes longer with the foaming oil.Edit: I've tried poaching(?) the French fries, but they foam during poaching. Then when frying, they really foam. I have to keep an eye on it or the oil spills over the top. Anything I can do about it, or should I just go ahead and discard the oil altogether?Edit: Serious Eats has an article about frying oil.",

If you don't dry your potatoes sufficiently they can quite easily cause the oil to 'boil' explosively out of the frier; this is why you never pour water on a deep-fat pan fire.There are various ways to dry out your chips/straws, but one of the most effective ways to is to lay them out on a tray or plate and put them, uncovered, in the fridge for a couple of hours, making sure there are no strong odours in there first. Not only will this prevent too much foaming, it will result in really crisp chips! CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "I don't normally make a lot of confections but decided recently to try a few new things.Yesterday I used this recipe for Turkish delight which I originally found on the Hydrocolloid Recipe Collection. It uses agar as the gelling agent and appears relatively easy to prepare (that's why I tried it). Basically you just dissolve some agar in warm water, orange juice, and lemon juice, add sugar, simmer it, then cool and refrigerate to set.Unfortunately, what I ended up with after refrigerating overnight was closer to the consistency of jam or marmalade than a Turkish delight. It was far, far from delightful.When I prepared this I didn't actually follow the source URL and noticed a few differences that may account for the problem (but I'm not sure, that's why I'm asking):The original recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon of agar; the one in the collection specifies exactly 1.2 g.The original recipe specifically says to cover with a cloth; the collection recipe is not so specific, it just says to cover (I used plastic wrap).The original recipe says to refrigerate in an ice-water bath; the collection recipe does not (I just put the dish in the fridge).Other issues that may have been causes:It turned out that my scale wasn't precise enough to get exactly 1.2 g. The amount I used could have been anywhere between 1 g and 2 g. In retrospect, I wish I had checked the original recipe and simply used the 1/2 teaspoon that it called for.I got the agar from an Asian grocery store, and the packaging clearly said \"agar agar\", but I did notice that it had two ingredients, the second one (after agar) being vanilla. I'm not sure whether this is normal or whether it might have been diluting the agar mix.I did notice that it did not seem to be gelling at all while it was coming down to room temperature. It was basically a soup until it had been refrigerated.Can anyone identify the most likely reason why this didn't work out? Did I use too little agar? Too much? Could some of the differences between the two recipe versions be important? Could it be something I haven't thought of yet?And equally importantly for the purposes of this question, can I fix it or am I going to have to throw it out?",

Of all of the things you've identified as possible problems, I think the biggest likely ones are the quantity of agar, and the agar powder itself. Everything else about the cooling issue is normal. Agar powders do vary. You want to find one that is pure, unadulterated agar, not one that is setup to be a pre-prepared dessert as those are weaker.If just for a laugh you want to try to save this batch, heat it back up until the agar fully melts, shear in a second amount equal to what you did last night, making sure it fully dissolves, then let it set again. I'm pretty sure that will work.You can also pick up a sub-gram scale on Amazon for around $20. Thanks, drug dealers! They are very helpful when making small batches of \"molecular\" recipes.

Anyway, the instructions says to use margarine to really get close to the original recipe, but butter is an OK substitute.

But others, especially the reduced fat varieties, can contain gums. They tend to separate when heated, and if this happens, your sauce will probably break. This is a good reason to stay away from margarine in cooking and use it as a cold spread only. Second, taste. The taste is different, and most people find that butter tastes better. Margarine is a substitute which can't quite reach it. Classical recipes are always made with butter, most of them predate the margarine era. In your case, we can hope that the author tested margarine in the recipe and found that it won't split in that particular process. Or maybe they were lucky to use a margarine brand not prone to splitting. Also, this is a recipe which tries to emulate an existing thing. If Pizza Hut are not using butter in their original recipe, but margarine or vegetable oil, then the margarine will get you closer to the original taste. So, this is a case where margarine and not butter will give you the taste you are after. You can probably substitute without much trouble, but if the recipe specifies margarine, I'd try the margarine first and only switch to butter if there are problems. CANNOTANSWER",

Most often, this is almond (it's what we have in the house for the kids to drink, and is therefore always on hand). However, if a recipe involves baking soda or baking powder, almond milk produces a less satisfying rise and there's a bitter aftertaste.I think this means that the baking soda is not reacting fully with the almond milk. Soy milk does provide the same \"lift\" and eliminates the bitterness the same way that dairy milk would. What's causing this? Is it possible to adjust our baking powder recipes to use almond milk, or do we need to buy two kinds of milk (one to bake with, one to drink)?While I'm hoping to get a general rule of thumb, here are a couple of the recipes we have noticed this with for reference.

      "background": "I have made both the classic and the speedy version of the no-knead bread recipe provided by Mark Bittman in the New York Times. The one change I make is that I use active dry yeast rather than instant, simply because I don't typically have the latter at hand. I measure out the amount of water the recipe calls for, take out a quarter cup or so, heat it for a few seconds in the microwave so that it is warm (but not hot), dissolve the yeast in the warmed water, then add the dissolved yeast and the rest of the water to the flour to make the dough. In the video that accompanies the speedy bread recipe, Jim Lahey suggests using hot water and adding a couple drops of red wine vinegar. The last couple of times I tried the recipe, I tried those suggestions. I separated out the water for dissolving the yeast and heated the rest beyond merely warming as needed for the yeast. I warmed the water for the yeast as usual. I added the hot water and a couple drops vinegar to the flour and gave it a couple of stirs first before adding the yeast water, as I thought the yeast would die if it came in contact with the hot water. Both times, the bread was disastrous. The dough simply failed to rise sufficiently. Instead of more than doubling in size in four hours, it looked as though it had gotten to perhaps 1.5 times the original size, and it was quite smooth, like kneaded dough, instead of bubbly and stringy as the no-knead dough is supposed to be. The first time, I thought I had made a mistake and added too little yeast, so I didn't think too much about it. The second time, though, I know I measured out the right amount of yeast and I was pretty careful in following the procedure. So I'm trying to account for the lack of rising. A little research suggested that perhaps the vinegar didn't help the yeast to rise, as it ordinarily would, but overwhelmed and killed the yeast. I used a stainless steel bowl for mixing dough and letting it rise. I know that using stainless steel is generally fine, but perhaps it's a bad idea to add vinegar to the dough if I'm using stainless steel? Would this account for the lack of rise in the dough? What other reasons might there be for the failure of the dough to rise? I tested my yeast with sugar dissolved in water and it's fine. Thanks!",

          "context": "First and foremost, the classic recipes states quite clearly, \"Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles.\" Expecting microorganisms to do their work in precisely the same amount of time, every time, requires a good bit of precision on your part.Why the slow rise? Almost definitely a yeast problem. The question is, which kind of yeast problem? Acid can kill yeast, heat can kill yeast, salt can kill yeast, sitting in a package forever can kill them, and there are other, less likely scenarios too.Are you using jarred active dry yeast or individual packets? You mention testing it, but what technique did you use, a little water and sugar, watch for bubbles? You can (and probably should) do this at the beginning of the recipe, so that your yeast is kickstarted into alertness.Stainless steel is not the problem. It's non-reactive.Vinegar is likely to slow the growth, so you probably just need to give it more time. The best way to judge readiness is by the dough, not by the clock.Another factor is that a few degrees difference can make a difference in the rate of yeast growth and CO2 production:\"With glucose as growth-limiting substrate in the chemostat and aerobic conditions in the respirometer, the carbon dioxide output was found to be higher as temperature at which the organisms were cultured increased from 25 to 39\" --Journal of MicrobiosologyHope these help, but I think there's not just one answer here.

Not what you're looking for if you want a light brightly flavoured fish sauce.In a traditional French kitchen you want generic stocks (fish/brown/chicken/veal) that are able to be used for a wide range of sauces/dishes so having a salmon stock around doesn't meet that criteria.That said, I worked at a restaurant that made fish stock from salmon bones all the time as it was mainly used in a house specialty, a very robust West Coast spin on Bouillabaisse. Any true Frechman would have turned his back on us in disgust for doing what we did but damn it, it tasted great and the customers loved it! For any other fish sauces we used the traditional white fish bones.FYI...Japanese dishes use Bonito flakes (tuna) liberally to make dashi(sp?) which is a fish flavoured broth for miso soup as well as other items.So basically what I'm saying is if a fatty fish stock gets the job done for you and you're happy with it then go for it. Just remember that if you're trying to make a classic recipe then using a non-traditional ingredient will mess it up. CANNOTANSWER",

To thicken a home made tomato sauce, I tried added xanthan gum. While the sauce did thicken (too much in fact, it was mucus like), it resulted in little white 'seeds' floating in the sauce, which was visually unappealing.First, I placed the sauce in a tall metal cup. I placed my immersion blender (with whisk attachment) inside and turned it on. With the high speed immersion blender whirring inside, I sprinkled xanthan gum inside, bit by bit.The xanthan gum powder did not mix well and white 'seeds' could be seen floating in the sauce.Are the 'seeds' a result of the xanthan gum clumping together? What should I do differently to mix it well to avoid this from happeningI should note that the sauce was quite hot (between 160F- 180F) when I added the gum. The sauce also consisted of mainly vinegar, and some sugar.",

          "context": "Kevin's answer is close: a slurry is best, but the mechanism and technique are different than starch based thickeners. With starches, the cells explode when heated, but xanthan gum simply needs to be hydrated, and it can be hydrated at any temperature. Mix a smaller amount of xanthan gum in water in your metal cup, add water, and blend it with your immersion blender. For your slurry, you're looking for a consistency which is much thicker than your sauce, but still thin enough to be able to stir in fairly easily. Like you said, add too much and you'll end up with a pan of tomato snot. A one percent mixture (1 gram of xanthan gum per 100 grams of liquid, by weight) will be pretty thick, even if the starting liquid is water. A little dab will do ya!Good luck! CANNOTANSWER",

They were layered with rice, beans, and corn, nothing else (I don't eat cheese and I wanted them to be non-spicy so I can eat them when I'm feeling unwell). The second batch replace the corn with ground beef, cooked and seasoned. The exact same beans, the same rice made the same way. They're smaller, due to using a different package of tortillas; after almost 2 minutes of heating in the same microwave, the meat burrito I had brought still had cold spots in the middle. What causes this? Can I avoid it somehow? Should I mix the ingredients instead of layering?",

So the aim is to put them directly into the oven tomorrow. I've done the cream and the boiling and they are in the tray ready to go, sans cheese.My question is: I followed the recipe but I'm not that great with the knife and thus my slices were a bit thick, probably 5-6mm.It said to cook them for about 3 minutes in the simmering cream, or until cooked. I must have cooked the potatoes in the cream for what felt like forever (well over ten minutes) and they did not seem to be thoroughly cooked. It did not want to boil the cream lest it split. So I just continued with a simmer and kept turning them so they didn't stick to the bottom of the pan.After well over ten minutes I was concerned about burning the cream though the potatoes still didn't look all that cooked. So I dished them out.My question is, will this be OK if the potatoes are not fully cooked through? Providing it's going to go into the oven with a layer of milk and cream it should cook the potatoes through so they are soft? Should I cook it a little longer and lower than the recipe states?",

However, there's no reason you would need to as they'll cook in the oven, in fact that's the idea, if you cook them in the cream until they are done they'll break apart. You don't need that step at all really, when I make Dauphinoise potatoes I don't cook them in the cream, I layer them raw in a baking dish, then heat the cream, garlic and a bit of nutmeg in a pan until bubbling before pouring it over the potatoes and putting the cheese on top. Then I bake at 165 fan until a skewer goes through easily, about an hour, maybe longer. Budget 90 minutes in the oven if it's a deep pan. This gives awesome results every time and is less hassle then par-cooking them in the cream, frankly I see no benefit in that method although there's nothing wrong with it. In your case as the potatoes are par-cooked then it will be less than 90 minutes, but it will take some time to get the dish up to temperature so it's very hard to say. Once you see the cream bubbling you'll know it's cooking, check them in 20 minutes and then every 10 minutes after until they pass the skewer test. CANNOTANSWER",

The difference, as you might imagine, has to do with the starch content of the potatoes. When cooked, starchy potatoes (like Russet potatoes) tend to break apart. They are often used in baking and frying. They also are more absorbent of liquids and fats. Waxy potatoes (like red potatoes) hold together more when they are cooked. They are more likely to be used in soups and stews. They also tend to have thinner skins than starchy potatoes. Yukon gold potatoes are considered in-between starchy and waxy. Their medium levels of starch make them a good all-around potato. But if the Yukon gold potatoes aren't working, I'd suggest using a starchier potato. One of the things that makes twice-baked potatoes so good is that the inside is mixed with other ingredients and then reheated. Starchy potatoes are more likely to absorb the butter/cheese/other ingredients. CANNOTANSWER",

After that we, wrapped it in tin foil, raised the temperature to about 300°F and cooked it for an additional 3 hours. Our thinking here was that we can raise the temperature a bit, since the moisture can't escape anyway because it's wrapped in tin foil.We were hoping for a juicy and tender roast, that \"tears apart\" easily with a fork. At the end it wasn't tender and it was so dry that we were afraid it would suck the moisture out of the air... When we unwrapped the tin foil there was a lot of liquid (juice), that should've probably stayed in the meat? Was the temperature too high or wasn't the cooking time right? Is this even an appropriate piece of beef for \"low and slow\" smoking?",

This is happening at the tissue/cellular level, so the wrapping won't stop that.The thing that could have helped is to keep it wrapped and let it cool to almost room temperature. As the meat cools, the structure relaxes and some of the moisture could have been drawn back in to the roast.Your theory of part wrapped, part unwrapped is fine, just keep the temperature down to 200 - 250 max. Use a rub and slow smoke. There are many BBQ charts and books and guidelines, but 4-5 hours at 225 sounds about right for that hunk. You could also section it down to two smaller pieces and you would have more control. CANNOTANSWER",

Individual brands have different levels of protein depending on their formulation. That protein, when combined with water, is what makes your stretchy gluten chains, and those are the difference between soft crumbly cake and a french baguette that could serve as a weapon in a pinch.As with many chemical reactions in cooking, however, you can interfere with the \"natural\" reactions by means of some clever chemistry. Cornstarch works very simply...Corn just doesn't have any gluten, so you're just \"watering down\" the gluten content of your flour.Acid retards gluten formation. Water is critical for gluten formation, unless you use a whole lot of it, in which case it weakens it (a wetter dough will make for a less gluteny final product). Mixing makes more gluten (helps the little proteins make friends with each other), so mix MORE for more gluten, and less for less. But fat is your friend. Fat waterproofs your flour, and keeps gluten from forming.Long story short, pick a method you're comfortable with, and stick to it. If you're used to using AP flour, you're going to have some headscratching moments when the cake flour doesn't behave the way you expect it to. On the other hand, cake flour will be more forgiving if you overmix. CANNOTANSWER",

Before the invention of the digital scale (recent history), or the spring scale (1770, by a Brit) things were weighed with a balance scale and a set of weights. Materials alone makes this more expensive than a simple cup that would hold a liquid. Given the timing of the invention of the spring scale, and our subsequent armed revolution, and many years (decades?) of being a flat-out poor country I don't imagine that we had much money to worry about spring scales or balance scales. A cup is cheaper and simpler, and doesn't wear out or break. The durability also likely had a role to play in our journeys westward.Likely by the time we actually could afford \"fancier\" methods of measurement the volume thing was just too ingrained in our heads. Plus, we tend to be stubborn (e.g. metric). CANNOTANSWER",

In order to serve the best possible soup, where should I stop preparation tonight? If I were comfortable with all of the ingredients, I would prepare the soup up to the addition of cream. Unfortunately, I know nothing of wild rice, and how best to hold it. Will it be OK overnight in the fridge? Even better, can I leave the soup (up to the cream addition) on the porch overnight? It's expected to dip 10 degrees F below freezing and stay there until morning.EDIT: My best guess is to add the rice to the soup now, store overnight on the porch, and add the cornstarch slurry, cream and the rest just prior to service. Would the wild rice hold up to that?",

(There's the additional problem that many flavors are destroyed at high heat; many more aromatic oils have lower smoke points.)Oils like sesame oil, chili oil, and walnut oil are decidedly not neutral. On the other end, oils like canola oil and grapeseed oil are neutral. Close to neutral, there are very mildly-flavored oils like peanut oil. Somewhere more in the middle there are things like olive oil, which has some flavor but isn't overwhelmingly strong.Note that sometimes there's more than one type of oil from a given source, often a more refined one that's more neutral and a less refined one with more flavor. For example, refined olive oil is quite neutral, but extra-virgin olive oil has plenty of flavor; \"regular\" peanut oil is fairly refined and mild, but there are also flavorful roasted peanut oils.

Also you can put in the milkshake machine with the milk, some small pices of ice cubes, this makes the drink a bit more creamy.This is usually a companion for Empanadas or PastelesWhat is the name of this beverage?

Is the saltiness essential to the preparation of dried fish? Can the fish be as nicely dried/smoked without using so much salt? Finally, the most important question is, is there a way to desalinate the dried herrings that I otherwise like so much? E.g.

Iit is very unlikely that everything else that is not on the list has been comprehensively tested and found known safe. Also, OEM manufacturers and raw material suppliers can change without the brand/order number of the product changing.What can help is researching (unfortunately, tiresome work) whether any reputable local supplier OEMs the exact same item - an (eg) European importer has some interest in not being in the focus of a product recall, so there is a chance they will have commissioned laboratory tests or taken other steps to make such problems unlikely, or their product might have even been the subject of a published safety test (eg in test magazines).

There are plenty of times where it is completely inappropriate to add an acid.A better comparison would instead be lemon infused olive oil compared to olive oil and lemon zest. There would still be a difference, but it would be less noticeable. The infused olive oil has had more opportunity to capture the fat soluble flavor compounds in the lemon zest, however the flavor compounds that aren't fat soluble will be forever lost.That is generally the trade-off when it comes to any infused oil. You will get lots of the fat soluble flavor compounds, but you will lose the non-fat soluble flavor compounds.As for difference of use in the olive oil and lemon juice case, yes, definitely. You can't always add acids to foods. In the lemon zest case, apart from the slight flavor difference, there's also a texture difference. Of course, if you want something very smooth, pieces of zest wouldn't be a good thing. Apart from those though, not really.

I have a Kitchenaid artisan mixer that has been doing the hard work of kneading for me. My problem is knowing when to stop adding flour during mixing/kneading.Some recipes say add flour until the dough is workable and then knead. My questions is, when they say use 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of flour but no more. How do I know when to stop, I have ruined a few loaves as they came out heavy and dense.How do I know when to stop adding flour and let the gluten take care of the stickiness? I often find myself adding flour until the dough balls up and pulls from the sides but by then it's too late.On the other side, I have kneaded for 15 - 20 minutes waiting for the dough to pull sides of the bowl and it never happened.When do I add flour and when do I just wait?Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!",

It is expressed in the amount of liquid in ratio to the amount of flour. This percentage varies according to the style of bread, but within each style produces accurate results when using weight measurement. Using volumetric measurement, especially for flour, is highly inaccurate because many variables can influence how much flour fits into a measuring cup (grind, humidity, compaction...etc). That is why these kinds of recipes often suggest a range, and put the baker in the position of guessing.Using a scale, and weighing your ingredients according to the baker's percentage of a recipe, removes the guess work.

If there had been anything in my mouth by the time that taste hit, I'd have spit it out instinctively. The recipe calls for 1/3 cup Bisquick Heart Smart baking mix and 1/3 cup buttermilk to make the dumpling dough; I doubled it because I was making a large pot of stew. The stew tastes fine once I ditch the dumplings; it contained chicken broth (made from bouillon cubes), milk, cornstarch, cooked chicken, parsnips, carrots, celery, and onions. The dumplings were dropped by spoonfuls into the stew and cooked for about 7 minutes, as per the recipe directions. I have not made this specific recipe before. The consistency of the dumplings seemed fine; they were a little bland due to lack of seasoning, but otherwise all was well until that aftertaste hit. What could have gone wrong? The buttermilk was purchased just a few days before, well within its expiration date (Nov 24th), and the baking mix had been used for pancakes earlier in the week (which were a little bland but not disastrous)",

I know their is the custard less variety, containing milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and any other flavoring or fruit they want. Recently, I found a recipe for 'banana pudding ice cream'. I decided to give it a go. Unlike the other ice creams we make, it has a custard base of milk, cream, sugar, and a pinch of salt. You add in pureed banana, a little lemon juice, and a little nutmeg. So I tried this recipe, doubling everything to get 3 quarts.It really didn't want to get made as first, the custard foamed up on me and ran over in about 3 seconds, then when I was blending the mixture, the bottom didn't come out with the rest of the blender and I lost some there. I persevered and got the mixture done and in the fridge over night. I put it in the machine the next morning, because it called for making it, folding in the crushed/frozen vanilla wafer cookies, and letting it set for 4hrs.I did this and it turned out great. It came out of the machine at the consistency of soft serve. I folded in the vanilla wafers and it froze from ~9-10am on to around 5pm. When we pulled it out of the freezer, it was a similar consistency and everyone liked it.However, the next day I didn't go back to the river and the rest of the family did. They ate more of my ice cream and while one person said it was really good and tasted the same, my dad said it had frozen funny. I couldn't figure out if he meant it crystalized or just froze up harder than soft serve.To be honest, I don't really eat leftover ice cream, because there are usually enough people to polish it off, so I don't know how either version turns out when left to freeze over night. What I'd like to know is what can I expect if I make another batch. I have a trip to the mountains this weekend to see more family and after hearing about it, they want to try it. I plan to make the mix and churn it up there, because I'm worried it'll do something funny if I freeze it too long. Is custard based ice cream supposed to be set up hard or can the soft serve consistency be what I expect? Is it prone to getting too hard or forming crystals when frozen over night? That's the kind of thing I need to know. I'd just like to repeat my experience with the good ice cream and I don't want to disappoint them by making a hard icy ice cream instead of the soft smooth goodness I made last time. Thanks for the help.",

However, if it is essentially fully cooked, you could blind-bake your shells then just put them together to heat through for service. You would need to share more details to get more specific advise.

The problem is that the whole process is somewhat finicky, and cooks need some experience until they reach a good match between the speed of pouring and the speed and area-coverage of whisking, so that the sauce does not lump. Once they have it, it only works for a given combination of temperatures - if they were to change the temperature, their usual way would stop working. This is why most cooks believe that making roux is temperature dependent. Once they have perfectioned their own process, they start prescribing its parameters in recipes when they pass them along. And that's how requirements like \"the roux must be room temperature\" get embedded in recipes. But if you prefer to learn doing it at a different temperature combination, you can - the only problem is that, if you already learned one combination, your first sauces at a different one will fail until you have relearned. Also, the colder processes are somewhat more forgiving than the warmer ones, as you have more time to react before lumps solidify. The roux itself is typically smooth, I am not sure how you would end up with grainy roux, especially for the lighter kinds. As I don't remember using grainy roux, I cannot say with certainty it won't work - if yours turns out grainy, try it and see what happens. CANNOTANSWER",

I also have a caramel syrup recipe that uses rum and it was a huge hit with the family. I am hoping to merge the two and make a spiced caramel candy that has rum flavor. I saw a recipe that called for 1/4 cup of Rum in its recipe, but I was afraid to add too much moisture to a recipe with honey in it (especially since the reviews for this particular recipe complained a lot about the caramels not setting properly), so I tried adding 2-3 tablespoons of rum during the initial heating of the sugar and honey. They turned out well as far as firmness goes but the rum seemed to evaporate and leave no flavor behind. Second attempt I tried adding a teaspoon of strong, dark spiced rum at the end after taking the whole batch off the heat, much like you would vanilla extract, but yet again there was no flavor left. This time they also turned out a bit soft.I guess I'm wondering... is there a better way to do this, or should I just use a rum extract instead? Do you have any experience adding rum or other alcohol flavors to candy? Thanks so much for your time!",

The manual states: Use only fuel-type alcohol. Never use gasoline, benzene or kerosene. Purchase fuel-type alcohol from a pharmacy, etc.However, what exactly should I be asking for? I live in Germany and none of the Apothek/Pharmacies said they had what I was looking for. I feel like there should be a more common name for the exact fuel I need to use!

You can't use butane, that's a different fuel and obviously not suitable for your case. You should be able to use pure ethanol, but due to alcohol import laws, medicinal ethanol without dilutants is extremely expensive, and medicinal ethanol with dilutants might have dilutants which create something bad when burned. Brennspiritus is ethanol with dilutants which can be burned safely, while still making it undrinkable. If everything else fails, you can start burning high-percentage drinking alcohol, my grandpa uses it sometimes on Spiritus burners. The problem (besides being more expensive) is that you need both a high ABV (something around 70% will be good) and a pure alcohol (vodka or obstwasser); alcohol types which you are likely to find at these percentages (such as rum) can leave layers of badly combusted gunk inside the burner.

          "context": "While you can easily melt a foil pan over a hot campfire, yours will be filled with juicy peaches - so assuming you don't over-cook it, you should be safe. 40 minutes directly on the coals might be pushing it though - consider using a gridiron to control the heat by elevating the pan slightly, and stick around to keep an eye on things... Remember, dutch ovens are thick, heavy, and slow to transmit heat, and the recipes reflect this.I would avoid doubling either the pan or the foil: you'll end up with an air gap between the two layers, which will likely just end up ruining the outer pan. Pay a little extra for the thicker \"heavy-duty\" foil and you should be fine.Wet sand between two pans is an interesting idea... If you try it, report back!My biggest worry here would be burning the peaches before they have a chance to release their juices (no slow warm-up with aluminum - you'll essentially be frying them). If you can elevate the pan, you should be fine; otherwise, consider macerating them first (if you have very ripe, juicy peaches, count your blessings and ignore this suggestion).Finally, consider that Harbor Freight sells cast-iron dutch ovens for $25. The quality isn't stellar, and it's extra weight to lug around, but you'll probably end up with better food all the same. CANNOTANSWER",

Pine nuts are somewhat easy, but who wants to carry a barrel of pine cones just to get a few nuts? I've never seen a macadamia or brazil nuts in a shell and been told Cashews aren't edible unroasted. You can also get creative using tools other than a nutcracker or your hands. I used to use the door and jamb (hinge side) in college since we had indestructible doors. Even keys and car keys are useful to wedge open walnuts. Some birds (crows/ravens) throw the nuts on the road and wait for a car (hat-tip to them clever birds). Pretty sure one of my friends uses his iPhone 5 as a hammer (it works, but don't do it).Finally, if you're concerned about oxidization on shelled nuts, I understand. As a delicious option, try placing shelled walnuts or almonds in cold water in the fridge overnight and rinse in the morning.

It instructed me to combine the ingredients like a pastry dough (cold butter cut into the dry ingredients, crumble, then add the wet ingredients). Then:  Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently 8-10 times. Divide into four portions. On ungreased baking sheets, pat dough into 4-in. circles. Cut each into four wedges, but do not separate.I followed the recipe to the letter, using a scale. But the dough emerged extremely sticky. Kneading was impossible. Forming into circles too: I spread it with a knife, but couldn't get it in any way into a regular shape. It stuck to everything, including a silicone rolling mat and a silicone spatula. The best description I can manage for the consistency is Nutella-like. Is this normal? If yes, why the \"knead\" instruction? If not, what went wrong?",

We still have about 1/4 a bushel of apples left, so I was considering making several fruit pies to freeze for the upcoming thanksgiving season.Thus far, I have seen several recipes that caution AGAINST freezing, some that have tips about freezing (namely, blind bake the crust before freezing, do NOT bake the fruit, bake the pie frozen, just add an extra 20-25 minutes to the normal baking time).Are there any other major concerns when making a pie specifically with the intention of freezing it? Should I add starch to prevent a liquidy mess? Should I try to drain the fruit first with a little salt to remove excess water?",

We put a couple of tablespoons of flour on the bottom for the juices, but we do that for fresh pie as well.We use tin and pyrex, whatever we can get our hands on. The main concerns we have is the apples juicing too much in the pie, so we assemble and freeze them as fast as possible. (And we made 18 two weeks ago Saturday) so every time one is done we run it down to the freeze to freeze it immediately, we freeze them uncooked. Don't thaw the pie as again the fruit will have time to juice. We unwrap it (we wrap ours in plastic wrap and then foil to protect the foil from some of the acidic fruits) and put it in the cold oven and start cooking it as normal.My family has frozen, apricot, apple, and blackberry. Also when doing the pies en mass like this, we roll our open crusts for the holidays as well, since the mess is already made. These are for the pumpkin, banana, and chocolate pies. The crusts alone we do let thaw before cooking, as they cook so fast. CANNOTANSWER",

They were larger than what I am used to for sweet potatoes, but looked similar, although they had a purple skin on the outside and white flesh on the inside. I figured since they were labelled as \"sweet potatoes\", I would prepare them the same way I like to prepare regular sweet potatoes, by boiling them first (for about 40 minutes), then removing the skin, slicing it into wedges and then pan frying them. I have done this many times with normal sweet potatoes, and it works quite well.However, after I boiled the purple sweet potatoes for 45 minutes, I pulled them out to take the skins off, and they were soft and stringy and incredibly off putting - they felt the same way as a gummy mashed potato would feel, and they fell apart all over the place.Are they more like a potato, requiring less boiling time? Or is there something else going on here that I am missing?Edit: I went to the grocery store today, and they are now labelled as \"purple yams\". I don't know if that makes a difference or not. I also got a picture of them, to make my description a bit clearer.",

They can be extremely tasty, sweet with a \"perfumy\" hint if you are lucky. They are best boiled with the skin on like you did and peeled afterwards (as the taste is preserved better that way). As for cooking time it really depends on the size (which means the potatoes are likely done at different times) but you can always feel when they are done by pressing on the potato with a fork - it should give slightly/be soft. I think it usually took me about 30min but I didn't use a clock. It may shorten the cooking time slightly to make holes in the potatoes with a fork (this also adds to the \"creaminess\"). I guess they do sometimes get a softer, more \"creamy\" consistency than your usual potato when well done. However the taste is richer and in my opinion far superior to orange sweet potato. If you prefer a firmer potato, just let your potatoes stay on the firm side (in my experience, though, the taste is enhanced by letting them go soft). But boiled ones would anyways mainly be for puddings as it gets rather sweet.For panfrying I would suggest avoiding boiling the sweet pots first. Simply peel/wedge them raw, fry them as chips until done and serve with a spicy/hot dip - yum. CANNOTANSWER",

How does the amount of water effect the likelihood of water boiling over? What role does burner temperature have? Will it only occur during a rolling boil?This is brought up by this comment by MeltedPez in one of the cooking pasta questions: The only other argument for using more water is that less water is more likely to cause the pot to boil over. Basically the starch in the pasta makes it easier for the water to form bubbles that collect and spill over when not paying attention. I've found that with a very low pasta to water ratio can end in a messy kitchen. This seems very counter intuitive to me initially, as I feel less water should make it harder to boil over the edges.",

          "context": "Adding a starchy substance such as rice or noodles to boiling water increases the surface tension of the water. When it's just plain water boiling the surface tension of the water can't hold back the force of the steam rising and the bubbles burst. Starches increase this surface tension making the bubbles more elastic/pliable (essentially creating a foam), thus requiring more force for them to burst. This makes the bubbles last longer which allows them to build up and eventually boil over. It's more likely to occur with anything starchy like rice and pasta.A lower temperature should help to control a boil over as it will allow the water to cool somewhat and slow the boil.I'd assume that, from your quoted text, that if you use less water you're still imparting the same amount of starch making a thicker solution. More water would dilute this and bring it closer to normal water. In my own experience, small amounts of water allow lots of bubbles to form but nothing really boils over, it just splatters a bit. But reducing temperature and tilting the lid to let some air in has helped me in the past. CANNOTANSWER",

Your food should be about 8 to 12 inches away form the heat source, but most under oven broilers have a fixed height away from the flame. You need to make sure that your fish is fully scaled before cooking and you should season it with salt and pepper as well. Lay the fish on a pan, making sure that you lay it skin side down and that there is room on each side of each piece. Turn on your flame and slide the fish under the broiler, remove when the fish is flaky, white and lightly browned on top. If you are unsure if it is done, take a fork and twist it in the flesh of the fish and it should flake away fully white, it's done.Then add your sauce and serve.Additionally, BBQ sauce will mostly overpower the flavor of your tilapia, you might find that whipping up a butter sauce or a white wine sauce will suit you better. Also, alot of fish does well with just a little salt, pepper, and lemon juice. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "After enjoying many of the recipes out of The Bread Baker's Apprentice I moved on to Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads to learn about how to make hearth-style 100% whole grain bread. Unfortunately my first loaf reminded me of the total flops I used to make before reading through BBA and using its recipes. It was like a bread brick. I ended up deciding that croutons were the only suitable use. Since then I've made more recipes from the book, but always using his \"transitional\" variant of half bread flour, half wheat flour. These have risen and proofed perfectly.The technique from Whole Grain Breads involves pre-doughs. Flour, a very small amount of yeast, and water make up one dough ball that is placed in the refrigerator overnight. More flour, salt, and water are left as another dough ball on the counter overnight. Both enzyme activity and the rise in the fridge contribute to the texture and taste of the resulting bread, at least as far as I understand the theory. The next day the final dough is formed, allowed to rise once and proof once, and bake.With my first loaf I attempted a free-standing boule. I know that surface tension is critical to getting a boule to rise up and not out, but I am pretty sure that my surface tension on the boule was correct. For the transitional loaves since I've used a loaf pan and a sandwich shape, which may have helped them to rise. I've also done transitional pitas which seemed to puff up just fine during rising, even during proofing as small boules before rolling out.I don't want to try the 100% whole grain recipe again without knowing that it will work. I know that some bakers add vital wheat gluten to 100% whole grain recipes to ensure that they rise, but it seems like Reinhart's recipes should work without the additional gluten. Any other ideas for what may have gone wrong?",

If you can feel gritty shards then it will have trouble rising.2- Add vital wheat gluten. This may be seen as cheating and is similar to the transitional recipes that you said you had success with. Many whole wheat recipes call for extra gluten.If you don't add more gluten in some form you can make a successful boule but don't expect it to be as light and open as one made with white flour.What you might lose in delicateness you will more than make up for in flavor and nutrition.

And have any actual studies of this technique ever been published?I still recommend this money-saving idea to current students, not keen on bad practices being continued though.",

After this, she puts the yogurt into the fridge. She makes enough yogurt for ten days; on the tenth day she takes the last yogurt portion and makes some new. At the first thought I couldn't imagine that fresh fruits stay safe for ten days (I wouldn't eat cut fruits that stayed for ten days in the fridge!). But after some pondering I wondered if it's safe after all because the milk and the fruits are going to be cultured and undesired bacteria are going to be eliminated. I think freshly diced fruit only contain bacteria on the surface. 1 I saw a really big jug of milk. She lives in Georgia, US. I don't know what's the common treatment of milk there.",

It basically blows hot air over the kernels, and after 2 minutes they start popping.You're not supposed to add any flavoring agent (salt, sugar, ...) in the machines as it's not made for that. So when I want to add flavor, I spray water onto the popcorn right after it has popped, and then scatter the flavoring agent. This works relatively well.The downside: the popcorn can become damp (I solve this by leaving the machine on, which blows hot air over the popcorn)you can waste some flavoring agent (not all of it sticks to the popcorn, some of it falls on the bottom of the bowl)The upside:no fat used, healthier and your fingers will be less \"greasy\"Any other ideas how to flavor your popcorn using no fat or a minimal amount of fat?",

If you can't find any, and don't feel like ordering it online for some reason, putting salt into a high speed blender, spice grinder, mortar and pestle, or some other grinding device does the trick.

If I do this, will the oil evaporate -- I thought I experienced that once?Or am I supposed to preheat the dutch oven (starting on low and then going to medium) and then throw in the oil and heat it?I'm asking this question because I don't want to ruin my le creuset french oven.Part TwoAnd how do you know when the oil is hot enough?

Generally cast iron should be heated gently, depending on your stove it should probably take about 5 minutes to get to a good temperature. The oil shouldnt evaporate - I've never experienced this. As to the type of oil - I use various depending on circumstance vegetable or olive usually.Part two:I generally shake the pan gently - when the oil becomes more less viscous (more runny) then it is at a good temperature to start cooking. You can also put something like a small piece of onion or bread into the oil - if it starts bubbling and generally cooking then its good to go. Some people use a couple of drops of water to see when it spits but I dont like doing this partly due to the safety factor and also due to the fact itll splatter over the stove top.It depends a little on what you are cooking - if you are looking to brown some meat for example you'd probably want it a little hotter than if you were just going to make vegetable soup.

I remember them well to this day, because the soy comprised maybe half the volume - the small pieces of soy were crumbed in a thick layer of corn flakes, holding firmly, and forming some kind of fluffy, crunchy crust.I tried to repeat this a few times, following various recipes about different foodstuffs crumbed in corn flakes. I never got this effect.Firstly, most of recipes call for corn flakes smashed/ground into small pieces. These had predominantly regular sized corn flakes. Then, full-sized corn flakes simply don't hold - I cover the piece of soy in egg, then crumb it in corn flakes, and most of the corn flakes fall off, either at once, or upon placing in hot oil. For the life of me, I can't get more of it stuck. I believe I'm missing some ingredients, and the technique might be different than what I'm trying, but I don't know what should it be. So, how do I achieve a thick layer of corn flakes breading?This is pretty much the look I'm striving for.",

          "context": "The comments have already touched on a number of potential solutions. The core problem seems to be that you need a thicker, more viscous batter than can hold onto the cornflakes better than raw egg. Egg is slippery stuff, and will tend to form only a very thin layer on whatever's being dipped into it, but you want something much denser here.In the recipe you included, honey makes the egg more viscous while seasoning at the same time. You could do the same thing by adding a small amount of flour or (appropriately) cornstarch to the egg before dipping the soy. You could even try going completely eggless and make a beer batter or tempura-style batter; depending on your recipe, you may need to back off on the liquid so that it remains relatively thick. Dip your soy into the batter, then into the cornflakes, and then fry or bake as you see fit. You can probably play it quite loose with the cooking time. Since soy isn't an animal product that needs to be cooked to a certain temperature for safety purposes, just cook until you're happy with the final product. CANNOTANSWER",

But these are not the dreaded \"flakes\" of failing seasoning, just buildups which are strongly bound to the pan.

So limiting the discussion to natural, high quality finishing salts, the differences are mainly texture and color. Some salts, like Maldon, are flaky, while others are large pyramids or cubes, and others tend to a small grain size and hold on to a bit of moisture. Each of these textures can bring something special to a finished dish. For example, flaky Maldon adds a delightful crunch, while another salt might adhere better to a French fry. Color, like the pink salt you mention, is used pretty much for the visual interest. And there is nothing wrong with that. Simply save it for a dish where it will be noticeable. For example, those pink grains would look amazing on a chocolate truffle, or a savory meringue.If anyone thinks they can actually taste the difference among unflavored finishing salts, I'd challenge them to do a triangle test with those salts dissolved in water (in equal amounts by weight) so that texture and color isn't confusing the issue.

      "background": "Ordinarily when we make pizzas we throw all of our toppings on and then put raw chicken right on the pizza. Put it in the oven at 425 for about 30 minutes and it's good to go.This week, the supermarket was out of the chicken we normally buy, so we decided to mix it up and try sirloin.If we try the same thing with the sirloin (putting it on the pizza raw and cooking it at 425 for 30 minutes) will it be safe to eat? Will it get tough and flavorless being in that long? Would it be a better idea to pan-fry the sirloin and then put it on the pizza after we pull it out of the oven?EDITTook Navajo Dreamchild's advice. Ended up using a marinade with pineapple and soy sauce (who says pineapple's not allowed on pizza). Sauteed the sirloin to just about medium rare and then threw it onto the almost done pizza with a little more cheese before putting it back in the oven to finish.I wish I'd taken a picture to post here, but it was all gone before we knew it. Absolutely delicious--thank you for the help!",

I would think that if you were to pre-cook your sirloin and then cook it on top of the pizza for that long you might get tough sirloin. I would suggest cooking the sirloin until just about done, while the pizza is cooking then putting the sirloin on the pizza (I would add a little more cheese at this point- but that's just me), and giving it 2-3 minutes under the broiler to melt the cheese and cook the sirloin the rest of the way. To avoid losing the flavor of the meat, you should marinade it for at least 30 minutes and season well before you precook or put on your pizza(use a meat tenderizer in your marinade to avoid tough meat- vinegar or pineapple juice works well.) Good Luck- I hope it turns out delicious. CANNOTANSWER",

      "background": "So I routinely serve up very simple style burritos in my apartment (beef, sour cream, cheese and white flour tortillas), and I've grown well past the days of using pre-mixed seasoning packets to flavor the ground beef.However, after a particularly tired night where I reneged on that and used a packet that I had leftover sitting in the pantry, I realized just how much flavor it managed to impart into the beef comparative to what I normally get out of my manually done spice blends.Typically speaking, I use a blend of:Chili PowderChipotle PowderCuminMustard PowderFreshly Cracked Black PepperTouch of SaltCinnamon (just a touch for somesweetness)I brown the beef, drain off the fat, and then get it back in the pan to simmer in a mix of red wine vinegar and water for volume. When about half of the liquid is gone, I then add the spice mix.Generally I get the heat just right with the chili/chipotle, but it's not quite salty enough and the cumin flavor doesn't seem to really impart itself enough to the point I'd like. Likewise, there's only a hint of the vinegar flavor, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when all of the other flavors are weak, but if the other flavors came more to life, I'd expect the vinegar flavor to be at least a bit bolder as well.Is there an ingredient I'm missing for this type of cooking that aids in making those flavors really stick to the beef? Or is this possibly just a case of \"add more X\"? Possibly a technique / timing issue? Alternatively, is there a spice out there that you could recommend as a stronger version of any of said ingredients? I'd really like to NOT overload the salt levels, and I'd also prefer to keep straining off the fat from the browning process.Thanks in advance!edit: Thank you all for the suggestions! I'm making them again tonight and will be trying a combination of Bob's and Mrs. Garden's answers. Going to be adding Worcestire Sauce, replacing water with Beef Stock, upping the amount of Cumin and using some fresh minced garlic towards the end of the simmer (and maybe some onion powder as well). I'll update when the verdict is out.edit 2: The fresh garlic and extra cumin definitely brought out some more flavor, and the Worcestershire definitely gave a bit more punch than I would have thought it could possibly do. The flavor was fantastic, albeit a bit overpowering, but that I'll attribute that to having to readjust the amounts of everything with the new ingredients / ratios. Thank you all for your suggestions again.",

If you don't want to put forth that extra effort, you'll just need to add more cumin. If it's not salty enough, the best solution is to just add more salt (sorry). Salt will enhance the other flavors as well. A bit of cornstarch would help make the spices stick, and dry out the mixture. I'm not sure how much water and vinegar you're adding, but you may just be watering down your beef too much. I usually add just enough to keep the spices from sticking to the pan, but not so much that there is a lot of extra liquid that needs to be reduced.Your spice mixtures may also contain some form of MSG. You can get a similar umami \"punch\" by adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce.Edit: I don't know how I missed this, but the other answers point out the lack of garlic and onion. Your store-bought spice mixtures definitely contain plenty of those in powdered form, which you can use, but fresh is tasty too. Don't add fresh garlic too early, as it can easily burn and turn bitter. CANNOTANSWER",

They can be prepared in dishes both ways. They too break down in liquid much easier than the fenugreek seeds.

These would include molded and enrobed chocolates such as chocolate bars, bonbons, leafs, and nests.Recipes that add chocolate to other ingredients such as dairy, flour, and sugar can be made with either tempered or untempered chocolate because the structure of the chocolate fat crystals is no longer the dominant source of structure and texture. Examples of this include cookies, brownies, ganache, ice cream, and cakes. There is no normal application where untempered chocolate is required and tempered chocolate could not be used. The only application I have been able to think of where untempered chocolate would be desired/required is something made for the express purpose of training and/or testing chocolatiers or chocolate tasting professionals.

That way at each stage the liquids won't be vastly thinner than the peanut butter, so stirring will properly mix the two. Once the peanut butter mixture is thinned to the consistency of, say, mayonnaise, you'll be able to add the rest of the liquids.It's the same principle when making gravy from flour, fat and broth. If you add all the broth at once to the roux, you'll end up with lumpy gravy. But, if you add a bit of broth at a time, stirring until smooth each time, you'll never have lumps.To fix your problem in hindsight, try running it all through a coarse sieve, or use a potato masher on it.

White onions have some of that same sharp flavor, and are quite strong. Yellow onions are much milder and sweeter, and might not be such a close flavor match. Red onions are somewhere in between, in my experience. I would probably try white onion, but in much smaller quantity than called for of scallions.It's also important to consider how the scallions are being used. If they're being cooked into the recipe, that's very different than if they're being added right at the end, or even as a garnish. I think the substitution is less of an issue if the scallions are to be cooked. If they're to be more or less raw, I'd suggest white onion, not too much of it, and sliced very very thinly, as a raw white onion is really strong.Whatever you try, bear in mind that it won't be exactly the same.

In gluten-free bread, it's used to provide the stability maintaining the bread structure (in absence of gluten's ability) for leavening by carbon dioxide from yeast. So a goodly sized group of people on the recent gluten-free fad who want to eat natural should be happy with you using it.One caution: Although I've never heard of someone being allergic to xanthan gum, the substrate the bacteria is grown on includes corn or wheat. For someone with extreme sensitivity to corn or wheat, it's possible (though extremely rare) that an allergic reaction could be triggered. You can get around this by buying xanthan gum grown on lactose instead. I'm not sure how easy it is to find it as I've only been able to buy xanthan gum with no info on what substrate was used.

But when an instructor showed me how to skin a trout fillet, the knife wasn't particularly sharp, and the technique seemed akin to scraping the flesh off the skin in one pass. I've even seen some information on-line by a surgeon who got good results with the \"blunt dissection\" approach, skinning a fillet with the handle of a table spoon. I haven't bought a boning/filleting knife yet, but in experiments my chef's knife (I know, too thick and stiff) tends to cut right through the skin.I'm coming to the conclusion that a knife for this purpose should be only moderately sharp. (Part of the problem may be standards-- I hone my own knives, and I don't call a knife sharp unless I can shave the hairs off my wrist with it.) Am I on the right track?",

If it were just one egg per four cups of potatoes to help bind them or a little egg wash he might be okay, but the recipe as written has too many yolks. Based on experience, this will cause an allergic reaction.What can I do to get the same binding effect in the recipe with fewer or no egg yolks?Is there something I can substitute? So far my Google-fu brings up many alternatives... for brushing on top of bread, not breading and frying.Could I dilute the egg yolks and still have enough of an effect? For example, if I make a double portion and use one full egg plus the white from a second egg for both mixing in as well as the egg wash. That would likely be dilute enough not to trigger an allergic reaction, but would there be enough yolk to get the job done?There are no other dietary restrictions relevant to this question.The recipe: Loaded Cheese-Stuffed Mashed Potato BallsFour cups of cold mashed potatoes mixed with another cup of toppings and one egg, and another egg used as an egg wash.",

Some of the few recipes i’ve found place them in a bath of ~65-70°C for some 30-120minutes. This feels a bit short for my taste, as i’m not sure whether the breastmeat will reach the desired temperature at its core in such a short time. So the time-temperature for this cut in sousvide would be one point i’m interested in.Furthermore, i’ve often heard that poultry especially contracts muscle fibers when “temperature shocked”. So i guess i’d start the bath with cold water and cold meat, to get a slow heat-up.The last question is for sauces which could go well with it. The meat itself should be way more aromatic than many other poultry meats. Due to this i’m not sure if using the liquid from the sous-vide-bag as a base for sauces (i.e. fruity riesling butter sauce with caramelized onions and some mushroom bits? Maybe others?) is a good idea. On the other hand, if not using the meat-juices there’s pretty little base you can make a sauce of … right?",

          "context": "One of the benefits of sous vide cooking is that you cannot cook food over the temperature set, if you set the temp to 70 degrees it's physically impossible for it to go over that. This means that if you cook it longer than it needs to get up to the desired temperature you won't dry it out. I would think for guineafowl that 120 minutes would be enough. As for temperature shock you'd have to go much higher than 70C to run into that, so I'd start with the water at your desired temperature. As for sauces guineafowl is very rich and savory, so something with acidity would help to balance it. I like your sauce idea and think it would work fine. Riesling is a good choice if you get one with a more mineral character than a sweet bomb, although a squeeze of lemon can supplement the acidity if needed. CANNOTANSWER",

Now I'm wondering in what I should store the combined milk...I still have a 1 gallon container from the last milk I purchased which I can use. There's a tiny bit of milk left in there, but it will be finished by today. The only thing I'm worried about is that, even if I wash the container the best I can, it will still have traces of bacteria in there from the old milk. Does this mean, then, that I should treat the expiration date of the combined milk as the same date printed on the old container?Should I store the milk in some other container (e.g. a pitcher)? Should I temporarily combine the two in a pitcher, then put them back in the two half gallon containers they came with? Any other ideas?",

I've also noticed that the skin gets crispier when you salt it between the skin and the meat. You can use a spatula as BaffledCook says but I find it easier to just use my hands. Just find a spot on the bird's breast where the skin and meat are a little separated, like the chest cavity opening, where it's been cut during butchering. Slowly slide your fingertips in between the skin and the meat, separating the two, and work your way all over the breasts with both hands. Go slow so you don't tear the skin. If possible, leave the skin attached at the breastbone and near the wings, that will keep the skin relatively in-place for presentation and there isn't much meat that needs seasoning in those spots anyway.You can work your way over to the thighs and drumsticks this way too, though if you do, the skin will be quite separated from the carcass and your presentation will suffer more. Also, thighs and drumsticks aren't quite as thick as the breast, so salting them on the surface of the skin is more effective. CANNOTANSWER",

When you're done you can squeeze the soft, roasted garlic goodness out of the root end of the skins.

(More towards the edges). It wasn't a lot....but the thing is I know this thermometer is accurate and I always use it.....Plus I cook them like this all the time. So I didn't understand why it was still a little pink on the inside. Just for reference I stuck the thermometer on the inner most part, I made doubly sure. And they were all checked and all were 170-180 after they had been cooking on low (So it was prolly a high temp earlier when they were on medium)Any ideas? Im kinda scared.

As 40 hours is scant 2 days and you are not using any ingredients that will spoil quickly, a fridge should suffice. Advantage: use right away w.o. thawing. Also avoids condensation from thawing, but propper wrapping should take care of that problem anyway.My calculation: If you freeze the dough it'll need a couple of hours in the fridge to thaw, so assuming 2-4 h until frozen, 6-8 h to thaw (depending on shape): What difference makes 30 h at -18°C instead of 4°C?I'm speaking from 30+ years of experience (we make a LOT of cookies here in SW Germany around Christmas). Neither my Mom nor I ever had mold problems after two days in the fridge. One drawback though: If you prepare the dough and don't get around to baking it, the feezer would have been the better choice.EDIT after clarification:I guess we're talking something akin to pasta dough here? IMHO the same principles apply. I'd be a bit wary if you use eggs. Use fresh eggs or pasteurized, if you can get them. CANNOTANSWER",

It's not such an extraordinary recipe, I suppose, but the hot fudge is simply not a topping we keep in our house or really have a lot of experience with. So after picking up a jar of hot fudge topping, and zapping it in the microwave, per the instructions, I experienced the obvious result that has presumably been experienced by millions before: hot fudge melts cold ice cream.Rather quickly, the sundae disintegrated into a soupy mess at the bottom of the bowl, with a rapidly decreasing scoop of ice cream bathing in the pool, and banana bits swimming about. It was not a pretty sight.What means could I take to mitigate the fudge's effect on the ice cream, or are my wife's hopes and expectations just a dream in the shadow of this bleak reality?",

Letting the dough rest in the fridge or freezer for 20 minutes prior to baking can help avoid this as well.Alternately, substitute oat flour (grind some oatmeal in a blender / spice mill if you don't have any) - it has no gluten, and will add a pleasant, nutty flavor to the cookies.

If I invest the time and scrub, I can remove most of the rust.When I initially posed the maintenance question in IRC concerning rust and utensils and kitchenware in general, I got suggestions from \"spend a little on a decent one\" to \"you want stainless steel\". I stored both answers as helpful for future purchases.Just recently I noticed two can openers in the office pantry that both show rust. Obviously these were neglected and showed more corrosion. After seeing this, I am curious if rust is actually normal and harmless. Are there more expensive stainless steel can openers that are rust resistant? Should I be drying more rigorously? I just thought of another possibility: should I keep the can opener in a jar of cooking oil?",

The glaze will be made from a starch which will be boiled with water and sugar, poured over berries in a jelly roll pan and refrigerated to soft set. They'll then be placed into a cookie crumb crust and put back in the fridge to finish setting. It's all fairly simple.However most of the recipes I have found call for cornstarch. The store-bought glaze mixes I've found include tapioca starch (along with citric acid, salt, and some natural flavors/coloring). I have both tapioca starch and cornstarch on hand, as well as potato starch. Is there a benefit of any one over the others? For instance, I have read that cornstarch can impart a significant cornstarch flavor. Also, cornstarch will often result in a cloudier appearance when set. The goal here is a completely transparent appearance so one could barely tell that there was anything beyond fruit present. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",

Cornstarch is a mealy starch, with high amylopectin content, and creates a soft, fluffy, somewhat cloudy mass, not as glossy or as transparent as waxy starches. By the way, it shouldn't have an off-taste if you cook it through. I guess that most recipes haunting the Internet use cornstarch because it is so much more common in a home kitchen, and the home bakers found the result good enough for their purposes and/or were not aware that tapioca will give them a better end product.

Smoke one with the pan and one without and see if you think the moisture content is satisfactory. The briskets won't cook exactly the same but the relative moisture level in the shoulders should give you a decent estimate.I personally always use a water pan, but I don't usually fear meat from a smoker being \"too moist\", and it does wonders for temperature stabilization. I also have a larger smoking chamber than a WSM so it's possible that too moist is a larger concern for you.One last note, while cooking too hot for too long will inevitably dry out your meat, cutting a brisket or shoulder without letting it set for at least an hour (ideally 2) after cooking will also dry it out.

If you see some some orange color in the skin, it's almost certainly ripe, though they can still be mature when all green, too.Ideally, you should be able to trust that the farmer harvested these properly, but if you're getting unripened winter squash, someone probably screwed up out in the field.

When heated and allowed to release their full flavor and aroma into food though, they are phenomenal. There's a rich, luscious taste and smell, with an almost petrol pungency to it. The latter is primarily from the 2,4-dithiapentane, which truffle oil replicates, although it has a harsher and less complex flavor. Truffle oil will give you this top note, but without any of the additional layered complexity.All this said, different people have different reactions, and freshness matters greatly for raw truffles. If you really want to try truffle, canned or jarred truffle can be had in small quantities for under $20. The flavor is quite distinctive, unique, and pairs well with cream, milk, cheese, and butter.

On the other hand, if you're using a recipe with pectin instead of cooking it down until it sets, I definitely prefer having the skins in, for both flavor and texture.So there's some personal preference involved; I do rather like the texture with the pureed skins.

And if your recipe is pretty basic, you probably won't notice much of a difference in flavor between your pressure cooker method and a slow pan cooking.But if there are a lot of spices and time for flavors to meld, maybe even different spices added over the cooking time, then the slow pan method is going to make a difference. While the pressure cooker will make things cook faster, it won't necessarily make the flavors extract dramatically quicker, so you may find that the flavor hasn't really peaked in the shorter cooking time. Or if you expect wine, for instance, to permeate into the meat, it will do more of that over a longer cooking time, than the short, but more intense time that your food spends in a pressure cooker.An easy way to decide might be to think about if you have one of those recipes that is \"better the next day\". That recipe is likely to benefit from the low slow pan cooking.In the end, your best bet is to make it twice, in a reasonably short space of time, and then decide for yourself.

My tendency is to follow the store's practice of leaving this out, whereas my wife seems convinced they will rot in a matter of hours and insists they should be refrigerated.I'm more or less satisfied with refrigerating them--as long as it won't cause a problem.

Wash things as needed, immediately before using or eating them, and they will keep longer than if you wash them in bulk. Never neglect the washing, because they may have been sprayed with something to improve their shelf life - and remember this includes things like the peel of citrus fruits, which is often ignored by the pros.It is a fact that chilling foods can initiate mould growth, which will manifest itself quite quickly if the temperature is raised. If food was chilled when you bought it, keep it that way and the mould growth will be slowed down. If you put it in the chiller, keep it there until you use it.If you bought food at room temperature and it quickly goes mouldy, you can usually bet that it was chilled in transit. CANNOTANSWER",

I rinsed it and put it in a colander, but just couldn't squeeze out very much water. The pieces stuck to my hands, squished, and made gurgling noises; but for the most part remained sopping wet, and later tasted completely waterlogged. Am I missing something here? I know there's a way to get water out because I've tasted wonderfully light and refreshing seaweed salad before, but my wakame (even hours later) is just a slimy bowl of sopping seaweed. Thanks!",

Restaurants actually use specialized (and very expensive) automatic \"vegetable dryers\" that I believe operate on a similar concept as a clothes dryer. You're not going to get that kind of result at home. Just squeeze or spin-dry enough to get it past the \"sopping\" stage.It's also possible that you soaked it too long. More than a few minutes and it will just turn to mush, which may have been your problem. I've seen at least one ridiculous recipe for seaweed salad calling for a 5-minute rinse and a 15+ minute soak, which is pretty much guaranteed to give you slime. CANNOTANSWER",

Since I can't actually eat that much chicken, I just bought several pounds of bones, figuring I'd save the effort and expense of cleaning and butchering entire chickens.But now I'm wondering: Can I roast the bones by themselves?Most resources seem to agree that stock made from roasted bones is richer than stock made from bones that were boiled raw. However, every \"recipe\" I've looked at assumes that whole chickens are being used. I've never been taught or seen instructions on how to roast just the bones.So I have a few questions related to roasting the bones:First, is it actually practical? Is there any reason I shouldn't consider this?What would be the recommended oven temperature and cooking time for about 5 pounds of bones?Assuming I use butter as the base, how much would I likely need?Does it make any sense to brine the bones, or to season them at all before roasting?Should I bother including vegetables or other flavours in the roast, knowing that it's just going into a stock afterward that will have its own separate flavours?My intuition is that any special preparation, seasoning or additives would be pointless, but I'd prefer to go by facts rather than intuition. And even if I'm correct I'd still like to get some rough guidelines as to the oven settings, because if I accidentally burn them then the whole endeavour is a bust.",

          "context": "Roasting the bones will give you a darker brown stock than using the raw bones. To roast the bones, just stick them in an oven on high heat, around 450 for about 45 minutes, or until they are a nice golden caramelized color. Though you will want to make sure to keep an eye on them the first time, I'd check every 5 minutes after half an hour. Roasting the veggies with the bones will also add a slightly sweeter roasted flavor. It's like the difference of putting slices of raw onions on a burger compared to caramelized onions. You get a slightly sweeter, richer roasted flavor. Though it does turn down some of the other flavor notes, it's up to you which you'd rather have. Without roasting, you'd have a clearer \"white\" stock. If you are using the butter as a base to roast the bones, I would set it aside and go with a higher smoke point oil like a peanut or corn oil. The low smoke point of the butter could leave a bitter, slightly burned flavor, especially with the longer roasting times. I would leave the seasoning for the stock. Most spices will burn at a lower temperature, and salting the bones before you make your stock, could make your stock overly salty. It's easier to add more toward the end, than try to figure out what to do with salty stock.I hope that helps! CANNOTANSWER",

Salt the prawn for some time and allow it to marinate.Wash them. Fry them in some oil till they turn pink.Add onion, chillies, ginger, garlic. Some turmeric. Some tomatoes. The cuisine is Goan if it's of any help.This is exactly what mum does and somehow it turn out great. The only things different that I'm doing are:The original recipe uses coconut oil, I'm using sunflowerI'm using frozen prawns because i cant get hold of fresh prawns.I don't think any of this should affect the dish. Anyway, what always happens is that the prawns are either too chewy or too dry (opposite of juicy).What am I doing wrong here? How do I know if the prawns are just cooked right? Should I be using low or high heat?Any other tips for getting really juicy fried prawns?",

One thing which occurred to me is: why not use two matched, nesting glass pie plates? This would seem to provide maximum support to the crust, as it would exactly mirror the shape of the pie plate on the bottom. I always thought that the reason why nobody does this is that the crust needs to vent moisture, so the weight on the inside needs some porousness. However, Stella Parks uses aluminum foil filled with sugar, which would have no ventability at all.So, my question is: is there any reason not to use a nesting pie plate as the weight for blind baking? If so, what?",

(I don't know exactly how high it was, my thermometer doesn't go above 400°C). This was on an induction stove set at maximum, I doubt that any other kind of stove can produce such temperatures. Edit I just heard an example showing that you can take a pan on a resistive stove to above 500°C with prolonged heating, so you should be measuring it if you plan to go that high. (and if you have a thermometer in this range, you can post your findings to further limit the range of 400° to 500°C, because I'm curious). But if you say \"no contents\", be careful that it is actually just the pan. You cannot oil it, because the self-ignition temperature (of flash point) of vegetable oil is low, Wikipedia gives it at 327°C. It could just smoke terribly and throw a spark or two when you reach it, but it can also flame up and then you are holding a small brand in your hand. CANNOTANSWER",

Although I've made small amounts (like the above recipe) on occasion, I'd like to make a big batch, seal it up, and use it as needed.(I realize that it might not work as well a month or two down the road, I'll experiment with it if I decide it's ok to use.)",

If you freeze it (it can be done but the quality will really suffer later) you can get away with 4-6 months before freezer burn kills it.Honestly, I'd just do smaller batches and enjoy the higher quality product.

However, eggs are treated (typically washed) such that most egg shells do not contain any salmonella anymore.I eat eggs which I get from my mother-in-law who has her own chickens, so these eggs are not 'treated'. I was wondering a few things:What is the risk that these eggs contain salmonella? Is this risk negligible? Should I use supermarket eggs to make food with raw eggs in it, for example chocolate mouse, and only use these eggs for food which is heated?If there is a risk, how should I clean the shells? (using hot water is not an option for eggs, of course).A related question might be Is it safe to eat raw eggs?. The answer seem to be yes, but here it also seems that it is about 'supermarket eggs'.",

Part of the appeal of soda bread is that it's quick to throw together, so having to go shopping for a specific ingredient interferes with the spontaneous aspect. I know there are lots of substitutions for buttermilk (using a bit of lemon juice in regular milk is the one I usually use), but I'm wondering what it is about buttermilk specifically that seems to be a standard part of soda bread. Is it just traditional? Or will it add a particularly noticeable flavour/texture?Edited to add: I know that its functional purpose is to provide an acid to react with the soda for rising; so is it just that it used to be the most convenient acid?",

You can make rice noodles like a crepe rather than in an oiled steamer pan. Simply use a non-stick or oiled crepe pan, put in batter to crepe thickness, and let it cook until it begins to pull away from the edge of the pan.

Another setting: If you have a brittle knife and/or mistreat your knife you will chip it. As far as I can tell, this should mean that small pieces of metal (dust, shavings, etc.) come lose, and then likely get in the food.Is this correct?Are there no health considerations when digesting small pieces of very sharp metal?",

      "background": "I am working on a scratch chicken, vegetable orzo soup. I'm not following any particular recipe, just shooting from the hip. I usually come up with a good meal but the problem I always run into though is with gauging how much pasta (or barley or rice) to add to a soup and keep it at all balanced. Protein and veggies are easy since those ingredients usually do not change in size during cooking but whenever I use a starch that changes in volume while cooking I end up with a soup that is either starch heavy (too much grain or pasta) or starch light (too much veggie and protein in relation to the starch.)So my basic question is: I have a half cup of dry orzo sitting at the ready. How many cups will that half cup turn into after cooking in soup stock? I am using orzo right now but would also be interested in seeing similar information for other types of pasta and any soup-suitable grains. Any rules of thumb or ideas for different approaches would be appreciated as well.Thanks!",
