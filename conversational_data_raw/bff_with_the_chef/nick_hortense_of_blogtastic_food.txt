Nicole S.:         Welcome to BFF with the Chef. I'm your host, Nicole Schwegman. Aloha, friends and foodies and welcome back. Today, I'm speaking with Nicolas Hortense, the chef behind Blogtastic Food. Nick's goal for the blog as he puts is, is to get as many people's butts into the kitchen as possible. To Nick, food is just about the most important thing in the planet and he's on a journey to learn about different food cultures. Nick believes that home cooking can bring people closer together and he invites his readers to learn alongside him as he expands his food horizons. Hey, Nick. Welcome to this show.

Nicolas H.:       Hey, Nicole. Thank you so much. I'm super excited to be here. Thanks for having me on.

Nicole S.:         Well, first of all, I'm excited because I think you're my first guest from Australia and the fact of the matter is, is I love Australia. I got to go there. I'm still in the Navy, but one of my first most exciting like port visits when I was stationed on my second ship was to Brisbane.

Nicolas H.:       Oh, wonderful. I, myself, haven't actually been there, but I always wanted to go to Brisbane. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Get out. Okay. Where in Australia are you? What city?

Nicolas H.:       I'm in Perth, so I'm on the very far in Western Australia. Yeah. The place people mostly don't want to travel to because it's so far away.

Nicole S.:         No. I think that's awesome. You're right. It is really far away, but I do know of ships that go there and people say it's really cool. I have to remember. Australia is huge. It's like someone saying ... Yeah. It's like me being in New York and someone's like, "Oh, I went to Los Angeles one. Have you been there?" I'm like, "No." It's on the other side of the country.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Even just driving to a little town or something like that, you look on the map, you feel like you're on the same place after five hours or something like that whereas if you're in Europe, you'd be like past two countries or something like that. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         It's good. Yeah.

Nicolas H.:       It's really nice. It is a nice way.

Nicole S.:         Yeah.

Nicolas H.:       I tell you what? Hawaii is definitely a place I would love to see.

Nicole S.:         Well, it's pretty awesome here. I'm not going to lie. There's someone right now like hitting me for saying that, "I'm sorry. Moving in Hawaii, I love it." There are some people who don't like it. They get here and they're just like, "It's one thing you come here on vacation. It's another to actually live here," and I think what happens is people who'd come and they live here, after a while, they realized like, "Oh, no. You got to work every day. You think you're going to go to the beach every day, you're not." I can tell you, I don't go to the beach on a regular basis. I think it's because maybe I take it for granted. I should probably go more often.

Nicolas H.:       Right. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. I'm going to try to do that. Anyway ...

Nicolas H.:       It seems like a perfect place to skate.

Nicole S.:         No, no, no. It's pretty awesome. You should come visit. If you come visit, you better tell me because I'm going to take you on the ultimate big tour.

Nicolas H.:       I'm going to do that.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. For sure. Okay. I start every podcast out with these questions for my guests. Are you ready? All right.

Nicolas H.:       Sure.

Nicole S.:         Tell us about the last meal that you cooked for yourself?

Nicolas H.:       The last meal that I cooked? It was for lunch. I cooked myself a little like udon noodle broth just with a boiled egg and just some spinach and rocket. It was very simple. I'm actually trying to be as healthy as I can like really, really strict on myself because I've been basically all out of the gym and stuff lately. I'm trying to keep that nutrition on check. Yeah. Nothing too fatty. It's annoying because even things like rice and pasta and stuff. Even there, kind of like treats now, which sucks because I love those things. No. I'm being very disciplined in myself lately when it comes to food.

Nicole S.:         Okay. You said udon noodle though. Isn't that kind of like pasta? What makes that more healthy than regular pasta you knew?

Nicolas H.:       Honestly, I don't know. It was only a small handful, I guess. It's just about not having those things on a regular. Pasta is very, very carby and bread, you just got to make replacements for it. You could have the brown bread. Instead of pasta, you can have the protein pasta and rice. You replace it with brown rice and quinoa and couscous and stuff like that. Yeah. This is about being conscious constantly of what you're eating.

Nicole S.:         Do you find that because you are a chef, and I know I'm going to eat these other two questions, but do you find that because you're a chef that it's a little bit easier to do those replacements and substitutes and still make your meals delicious?

Nicolas H.:       Definitely. Yeah. Once you go into culinary school and learn ... Going into culinary school is about learning the basic cookery techniques. How to cook a piece of fish in a simple way and not overcook it? What kind of flavor goes with this and that? Learning that consistently, having to bust out these dishes over and over again and make sure the chef is happy with it. That is extremely a good experience to have and you'll just naturally be a better cook after that.

Nicole S.:         All right. Nick, what meal brings you back to your childhood?

Nicolas H.:       That's interesting. A lot of people will start cooking because of their childhood meals, but I wasn't one of those people. I just started it because I liked it. I'll tell you, my mom was very good at cooking in the winter. Whenever it was winter, she knew how to make this really nice comforting soups like mashed potato, all those things that fill you up. She'd always make this really cottage soups with pearl barley with them and stuff like that and filled with potato and I always remember getting really, really excited to eat those things. Yeah. Something like that. Definitely something in the winter and something like a really comforting soup, I would say would bring me back to my childhood.

Nicole S.:         You said something like mashed potatoes. Are you talking like a mashed potato soup? I know you're talking about like a barley soup too, but I hear mashed potatoes. Were there mashed potatoes in your soup? I just have to clarify that.

Nicolas H.:       No. She never put mashed potatoes in the soup. She just make really, really nice mashed potatoes. In fact, she always ... I remember not lacking sweet potatoes, but she put sweet potato in the mashed potato and I didn't know for like three years. She's always going to make me eat healthy.

Nicole S.:         That's so funny. You're just like, "I don't like ..."

Nicolas H.:       She was very [crosstalk 00:07:59] with those kind of things.

Nicole S.:         That was very funny. When you found out, were you like, "You traitor."?

Nicolas H.:       I don't know. I was just like, "Oh, yeah. I noticed the color if it was a little bit different." I never took notice of that. I could tell it's a little bit sweeter, but the normal potato just mustered out completely with that.

Nicole S.:         Now, you can't go five minutes without somebody on Instagram showing you a sweet potato, especially the sweet potato toasts. I don't know how I feel about that.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. It's a big trend, isn't it? Especially for all the vegans out there. I don't know. Maybe I'll have to try it. Maybe you've got a big of traction on Pinterest.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. I'm not going to shame anybody. I don't know that I will call it a sweet potato toast.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         I'm like, "How about a toast? It's just a slice of sweet potato. It isn't really delicious." Things like that.

Nicolas H.:       I know. Yeah. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         If he's saying toast to me, I want bread. Don't give me a sweet potato and call it a toast. It's not toast. It's just a sweet potato. Maybe if they have a bun take with it, I'll eat it. If somebody makes it for me, I'm definitely going to eat it but if you give me ...

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Like those vegan replacements like jackfruit as pulled pork and stuff like that. I totally agree with you. Just bring the best out of vegan food other than trying to replicate meat and toast all the time.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. I'm just like, "Just go in a jackfruit sandwich. I'm good with that." Jackfruit is delicious. I'll eat it in a sandwich, but don't tell me it's like a replacement for barbecue because then in my meat eater's mind, I'm like, "Okay. I take a bite into it and it's not satisfying because I'm wanting to taste just like a barbecue pulled pork sandwich and it doesn't because that's a lot to ask of a jackfruit." It tastes really good, but it's not the same. I don't know. I have no problem with jackfruit, but if you tell me that's a sweet potato toast, I'm going to be like, "You mean just a sweet potato with like a canape?" Call it a canape. I don't know. I've gone off and I changed it.

                        All right. There's someone out there right now going, "I can't believe she's making a problem with a sweet potato toast." I am not. I am not. I love the idea that you are making new and delicious food. I don't know. When I hear toast, I want some carbs and I want them to be in the form of bread.

Nicolas H.:       I'm with you on that. Totally.

Nicole S.:         All right. Finally, give me an ingredient you cannot live without?

Nicolas H.:       Oh, wow. You know what's funny? Speaking of veganism stuff. I've recently just gone vegetarian recently, and my favorite was smoked salmon. I have to go without that now. That was the one food. I was like, "I cannot go without this. I don't think I'll ever stop eating this," but I just have to now. Whenever I see sushi, like I love sushi. Sushi is probably one of my favorite things to eat, and whenever I see that really nice fresh salmon on top of a sushi, I just go nuts because I have to resist that. Yeah. It's interesting because when you go vegetarian, you have to open yourself up to new ingredients. That's what it's been about for me lately.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. Since now you said you've gone vegetarian, what ingredient ... Because I think a lot of people do like the idea of going vegetarian or going vegan. It's definitely really ... There's been a lot of folks out there revealing how they've gone vegan and showing me that it is possible to be a vegan and a foodie. I truly believe that, but what is an ingredient that, since you've gone vegetarian, has helped you meet that transition?

Nicolas H.:       Lentils.

Nicole S.:         Lentils?

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Interesting. I just developed approaching them and stuff like that, and I have them nearly every morning for breakfast. I just chopped some lentils in a pan and light with some tinned tomatoes, garlic and just slap them on some toast, some real toast. Yeah. That's been like a life saver for me, but then again, there are so many other ingredients I want to experiment with. Just saying one ingredient is tough.

Nicole S.:         I know. I know. People are like, "Well, you're limiting me to one." No. You're not limited, but I just like ... Lentil is a big ...

Nicolas H.:       Sorry. If I wasn't a vegetarian, I would definitely eat smoked salmon all the way. That was my favorite.

Nicole S.:         There's vegetarians out there right now going, "I can't believe ..." No. No. Okay. Everybody, I know plenty of vegetarian tell me that even if they sell a burger, they still want that burger, but they've gone vegetarian either for health reasons or for moral reasons or some people just want to try to eat a new way. Yeah. Hey, I get it and smoked salmon, probably very hard to resist. Hey, you can still ... My husband says, "I can be vegetarian except for chicken, and I can be vegan except for eggs." I'm like, "You mean that you're not either one." Maybe more like flexitarian is the term I've heard where you mostly eat vegetables. You're mostly vegetarian but every once in a while, you have some meat.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah.

Nicole S.:         I don't think anyone is going to take your vegetarian card if you have some smoked salmon. Maybe. All right. You went to culinary school. Can you talk to us about what was that like? I'm always fascinated when someone goes to culinary school and the things that they learn.

Nicolas H.:       Okay. Well, culinary school was ... It's such a new world to me because at that time, cooking was only a recent interest of mine. I won't even call it a passion. Once I know anything about food or cooking, it was never a big part of the family growing up or anything like that. No one was super passionate about it. We just ate because you don't need it to be cooked. The first half of the year of it was ... I want to say it was terrible, but there was a bit of a struggle because I was always the one with the messiest section. I was always the last one out because I was always the slowest cook. I didn't know much about organization in the kitchen and stuff like that. It was a bit of a struggle, but once I got the hang of it, that's when it's really started to ... I really started to like it.

                        I was watching a lot of cooking videos and basically, the whole year for me was just nothing but food. My brain was overloaded with food. I was very shy at that time, so it's a bit difficult to gain the confidence to cook in a restaurant once a week and do work experience. I did the casino, all the restaurants there. I did work experience in the casino restaurants. I've never done anything like that before. Yeah. I would say it was a whole new world for me just like they say in Aladdin, a whole new world.

Nicole S.:         What would you say ... You said that it was a big learning curve for you. You weren't even sure if this is what you want to do. What was that meal or that particular skill that made it click for you?

Nicolas H.:       Sorry. A particular meal?

Nicole S.:         Yeah. What meal? Was it something that you made that you're like [inaudible 00:16:21] now, or was there something that you watched? What changed you? You said in the beginning, you weren't very good and once you got the hang of it, when did you know like, "Oh, no. I'm good at this. This is what I want to do with my life."

Nicolas H.:       Well, I think the reason it appealed to me is I grew up being very creative. I always loved ... For instance, I grew up loving art because I loved how one pencil and one piece of a blank paper can be turned in something really, really fantastic. It can look really good. The same with cooking. Just a group of raw ingredients can be made into something that taste really, really good. It goes through this creative process and it ends up being something that's pleasurable that you can nurture people with. I know something about that that would really appeal to me. I remember watching, I'm starting out. I watched a lot of Jamie Oliver's videos, and I just love watching that process over and over again.

                        I think the first half of the year of my course, it was just the fact that I wasn't good at it that intimidated me. Yeah. I think I always liked cooking whether I was good or bad at it. Yeah. I would say it's that process. Just that creative process of chefs say like, "You got to treat your kitchen like an orchestra. You got to flourish where the kitchen ..." The ones that are really passionate. I can relate to that. Yeah. That creative process of just making something that completes people.

Nicole S.:         Well, speaking of creative. I was all over your blog this week. I love looking at food blogs and yours is a delight to go through.

Nicolas H.:       Oh, thank you.

Nicole S.:         We got to talk about this broccoli Caesar salad.

Nicolas H.:       Okay.

Nicole S.:         Okay. I've seen a kale Caesar salad. I don't know how I feel about that. Okay. I'll allow it. I've seen a lot of different variations on a Caesar salad, but this is the first time I've ever seen anyone just say, "You know what? I'm going to put broccoli in the Caesar salad." You got to talk to us about that. What was the inspiration and why broccoli?

Nicolas H.:       Well, Caesar salad is the kind of salad ... Because when you talk about salad, I don't think many people get too pumped about that, and when you talk about ... I think Caesar salad is a salad everyone loves, but also when you talk about broccoli, it's like a power food. It's really, really good for you, but it's not something that excites people. When you say pulled pork, people jump out of their seats, but when you say broccoli, it's like something you have to put up with now. 

Nicole S.:         There's this ad agency where the broccoli people are like, "We got to get broccoli into more things." It's just like, "What can we do?" "I know. Caesar salad is like ..."

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Put it in a Caesar salad. Put it in a dressing that tastes awesome. Well, that's the thing. I think it's what you do with the ingredient, how you cook it. Like I say in the post, if you just boil it in water and just ate it, of course it's going to be boring, but when you put it in a tray and chunk a bunch of like grainy cheese mixture on it, and then you got the cheesy cauliflower and broccoli baked dishes, you can do so many things with it to spice it up, so that was the inspiration behind adding broccoli to the Caesar salad.

Nicole S.:         It's interesting because a colleague of mine, we set a party and she made a broccoli and I was like, "Make sure you had some bacon." Those vegetarian, you're not going to do it. I like that you took something that people love, the Caesar salad, it is tasty and it's got that kind of salty brighty taste from the cheese. I know a true Caesar salad has anchovies in it, and I'm all about that, but you can do a Caesar salad without it. It's fine. You just don't have that anchovy briny taste, but you up that with the Parmesan cheese. You added a little bit extra and that creamy sauce. I saw that you actually ... You cooked the broccoli for a little bit. They say blanched?

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Blanched it. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         You blanched it?

Nicolas H.:       Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Now, were you doing that to make it just stay nice and green, or was it also to soften it just a little bit?

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. I think you can have raw broccoli. It's just a little crunchy. The best way to blanch any kind of vegetable like that is to just quickly light broccoli underneath for two minutes of blanching. Then, you just chuck it straight into ice water to shock it and that will stop the cooking process. That way, it's cooked but it's still got the crunch to it. I think that's the most satisfying way to have it. I know might disagree with that. You could eat it raw as well. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Now, I do. I think that's a little bit of a barrier for some people who don't like broccoli because it's really hard and kind of chewy. If you soften it up a bit, it just makes it a little bit more pleasant to eat in a salad. I'm looking at this picture. You added a soft, almost like a ramen typed egg to your salad. What made you decide to go with that?

Nicolas H.:       Well, I have seen eggs in a lot of Caesar salad, and it's something because again, as vegetarian, you cannot have chicken or you cannot have bacon to it or something like that. I think you just need something that just adds that a little bit more to fill you up a little bit more. Eggs always do that really, really well.

Nicole S.:         No. That's great. That's a great thing. If you were going to make the salad vegan, would you add ... Maybe this can sound sacrilegious, beans or what? I just wonder for our vegan friends out there who want to make this salad, is it possible or have you thought about that or trying to veganize it at some point?

Nicolas H.:       That was like a bit of thought, but I think you could do it. The base of the Caesar salad is you got your dressing, you got your coles and lettuce. You could make a vegan dressing because the dressing comes from the same way you make mayonnaise, the dressing, that's the process used to make the dressing. You actually can make a vegan mayo with like soy milk, so you could do that. Yeah. That's a tough one. You got your croutons, you got your salad. I couldn't add Parmesan cheese because that's a bit of a tough one. 

Nicole S.:         Yeah. Just a little bit. You might. That's kind of tough.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. Something that people replace with Parmesan cheese is a thing called nutritional use. It's like super, super healthy and I know yeast. When you saw yeast, it sounds absolutely horrible, but it is like a super plain food that you can eat and it has that slightly cheesy vibe to it. That would be a tough one. I think a lot of people would say ... I think people like you would say, "Oh, you can't say that to Caesar salad." Sorry, vegans. It looks like a nice salad, but saying that's a Caesar salad ...

Nicole S.:         Would be a kind of a stretch?

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. It's a little bit of a stretch, but who knows? Maybe it could be done.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. No. I'll allow the Caesar salad, it says toast. No. I think it's because I love bread so much. Yeah. I saw on your site, you also had a recipe for no churn ice cream. I think it was Baileys no churn ice cream, if I can look at ...

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. That's the one.

Nicole S.:         I'm looking at it now. It sounds just so delightful, but I'm so glad I have you because I've seen this no churn ice cream trend take a route and I have been trying to give in to my husband that I need an ice cream maker and he's like, "No. You have a small appliance graveyard. I don't want you to really think about if you need an ice cream maker." Of course, I think I need ice cream maker, but there is practically no more room in my cabinets for small appliances, but walk me through. The idea of no churn ice cream being able to just make ice cream without having to have the appliance sounds amazing. Can you walk us through how you make that?

Nicolas H.:       That's surprising you actually ask me about that. It's actually very, very simple. It's stupidly simple. It's literally two ... The way you do it is you get two cups of whipping cream. You whip it to [inaudible 00:26:03], you got to make sure you don't over whip it. When you over whip cream, it turns into butter. You want it to be nice and smooth and holding its shape. Then, you just add a tin of a sweetened condensed milk and you mix that together and that's literally your ice cream base. You put that in a tub. You put that in the freezer.

                        The next morning, you got a really nice ice cream and it's ... I don't want to say it's as good as normal ice cream, churned ice cream, but it's pretty freaking close. When you taste it, you're not getting like some cheap crappy version of ice cream. It actually tastes like legit ice cream, but you can add whatever you want to the mixture. Chocolate chips. It's endless. It's endless where you can add your fruit like caramel like I did, any kind of alcohol. Everything works. Yeah. It's a super cool trick, almost like a hack in a way.

Nicole S.:         It sounds amazing. It sounds too good to be true almost. There's like no ... Would you say it's not full of ice crystals or is it a little ice crystally? You know what I mean? Sometimes when you have an ice cream and you go freeze it, it's not quite as smooth.

Nicolas H.:       No. No. It's nothing like that. Yeah. I've made a lot of ice creams. I've actually experimented quite a lot with different ice creams and the ice crystals stay there, and it's just not the same thing. Yeah. It's getting so popular because everyone's figuring it out, so I'm actually starting to see a lot of no churn ice cream recipes, but it doesn't seem to be as much of a crazy thing anymore because everyone has just figured out the technique. The only I would say is when you add your flavors, it all sinks to the bottom. That's the only thing that you have to look out for, but other than that, it's pretty freaking good.

Nicole S.:         Okay. I'm going to have to try that. I'm not going to tell my husband because then he's going to definitely be like, "See, you don't need an ice cream maker." Come on. All right. By now, if you've been listening, all the folks have been listening now, I love pancakes. They're one of my favorite things. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I think it's my early riser. I get that from being in the military and it's a habit that dies hard because I'm always up before the sun rises. I love that part of the morning where it's just very quiet, and the world is very quiet and there's nothing more exciting for me to have for breakfast than pancakes, some bacon, a cup of coffee. I'm in heaven and I see you have a recipe for maple bacon pancakes. It sounds like a dream come true to me. Can you walk us through what made you decide ... I've seen recipes like that, but yours just seem so simple and delicious. Walk us through that.

Nicolas H.:       Well, first of all, I have to say I'm totally with you with waking up super early before the sun rises. It is super peaceful, but also the pancake recipe. Yeah. I've always loved pancakes myself too. I always find it hard to choose between crepes and thick pancakes, and the bacon and the maple syrup and all of that. Actually, I've never been a big fan of the sweet and salty, but there's something about bacon that just ... I don't know. It seems to work with everything. I've seen people put it in dessert, and it's taste good. Yeah. It was just a very simple fluffy pancake recipe. Yeah. I don't know. Everything just seemed to work together. Maple syrup and pancakes' just always been good. Yeah. That bacon just takes it to the next level.

Nicole S.:         It really does. It sounds ... Was it really a sweet and salty person? I don't know. I gotten into my 30s and my taste buds, I think started changing a bit. I love the whole sweet and salty mixture now of ... For example, I put Raisinets into my buttered popcorn when I watch a movie.

Nicolas H.:       That sounds good.

Nicole S.:         Yeah. It is very good. I saw a friend doing it and at first, I thought, "Disgusting." Then, she's like, "Why don't you try it?" I tried it. Then, like, "I am wrong." I immediately admit I'm wrong when it comes to food. It was delicious, and I've done it ever since. In fact, it's really delightful. There's this recipe from The Inn At Little Washington. I think I'm saying the name of that restaurant right. It's a restaurant outside of DC, and they have this recipe for truffle popcorn, but one of the ingredients that they add to it is like a teaspoon of sugar. Actually, maybe it's a tablespoon of sugar. That feels like it's too much. I'll link to it in the show notes, folks, but it is delicious and it does. It's not that you can overtly taste the sugar, but it gives it just that little hint of sweetness.

Nicolas H.:       Yeah. It's hard to find it. Yeah. Yeah. That [inaudible 00:31:56] powerful. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Just that tiny bit. Yeah. Yeah. So delicious. I'll send you the recipe because it's now my favorite popcorn recipe, and it's very fancy but I love it. It definitely requires some truffle ... Yeah. It requires truffle oil. Somebody right now is saying, "Oh, I didn't know you're so fancy." Yes. Truffle oil, worth the investment. Put it in the fridge, so that it doesn't go rancid. Yeah. It's delicious. Just put in the door of your fridge. They won't go rancid because the door of your fridge is not as cold as the inside of your fridge. That way, it will keep for a while but it's delicious. I'll send you that recipe and I'll link too in the show notes.

Nicolas H.:       Awesome. Yeah.

Nicole S.:         Okay. What is your favorite thing to cook?

Nicolas H.:       I guess I have to go with pasta. I love cooking pasta dishes.

Nicole S.:         Oh my goodness. Now, you can't have as much pasta as you want.

Nicolas H.:       I can have a protein pasta. That's the best I can have. I have to treat myself every now and then, but ...

Nicole S.:         How do you like the protein pasta?

Nicolas H.:       It's not bad. It's just that graininess that it has to it. The spelt pasta that they're selling now, like [inaudible 00:33:20] and stuff. Yeah. It's all right. I'm not amazed by it. It's just that it has this weird graininess that I just can't get my head around, but I eat it every now and then. Yeah. I'm trying to think about what my favorite pasta dish is, but I remember I always loved cooking seafood with pasta and probably I'll give you one of my favorites is a dish called spaghetti vongole. Vongole is just clams. What I love is you put the clams in the pan, you can put the lid on your steam. Then, all the natural juices will come out of them. That is just like super, super just like a flavor bomb. Then, you just toss the spaghetti through that and it's ready. It's like a 10, 15-minute pasta dish. It's just so exciting that it comes together so quickly.

Nicole S.:         What's one tip that you can give to that home cook out there that's been invaluable to you?

Nicolas H.:       What I would say there's a term ... I don't know if you heard it, but they use in chef industry called "Mise en place." Basically, it means everything in its place. Really, it means organization. The way I would do that is I would ... Say you have a recipe. You would get all of the ingredients. You would prep all of the ingredients, cut them, weigh them, whatever you need to do and prep all of the ingredients first. Then, you would start cooking. It's just knowing things like if you're going to make pasta, for example. You want to boil the pasta ahead of ... Make sure that's the first thing you do because the water takes like 10,000 years to bring to the boil. That's something you want to pre-heat your oven first. It's just those organizational skills, but making sure you prep all of your ingredients. Then, you don't have to worry about that while you're cooking. If you can get that down, you can pretty much cook whatever you want pretty consistently.

Nicole S.:         All right. Nick, where can people find you on the internet?

Nicolas H.:       You can find me at www.blogtasticfood.com. If you just google Blogtastic Food, you'll find me straightaway. Blogtastic Food on Facebook, Blogtastic Food on Twitter, Blogtastic Food on Pinterest. Then, Blogtastic_Food, I think on Instagram.

Nicolas H.:       Oh, definitely. Thank you so much. I had a great time. Thank you so much.

Nicole S.:         All right. You've just listened to me chat with Nick from Blogtastic Food. I'm not going to lie, I was really digging his accent. He sounded so chill and awesome, and it made me want to go to Australia and have some avo toast and a broccoli Caesar salad and just hang out with him there. You know what? Maybe someday I will get to. Maybe someday I'll get a chance to head to Australia again, and do some great cooking with Nick. Yeah. I highly encourage you to go check out his blog. There's a couple of things that Nick mentioned like that broccoli Caesar salad, and of course the no churn ice cream. I'll put links to all of those three recipes in the show notes.
